In order to understand the physical world around us, it is absolutely necessary to know the basic features of Physics. One or the other principle of Physics is at work in objects of daily use, e.g., a ceiling fan, a television set, a bicycle, a computer, and so on. In order to understand Physics, it is necessary to solve problems. The exercise of solving problems is of immense help in mastering the fundamentals of the subject. Keeping this in mind, we have undertaken a project to publish a series of books under the broad title Basic Physics Through Problems. The series is designed to meet the requirements of the undergraduate students of colleges and universities, not only in India but also in the rest of the third world countries.
     Each volume in the series deals with a particular branch of Physics, and contains about 300 problems with step-by-step solutions. In each book, a chapter begins, with basic definitions, principles, theorems and results. It is hoped that the books in this series will serve two main purposes: (i) to explain and derive in a precise and concise manner the basic laws and formulae, and (ii) to stimulate the reader in solving both analytical and numerical problems. Further, each volume in the series is so designed that it can be used either as a supplement to the current standard textbooks or as a complete text for examination purposes.
     Professor R. N. Chaudhuri, the author of the present volume in the series, is a teacher of long standing. He has done an excellent job in his selection of the problems and in deriving the solutions to these problems.

     It is a great pleasure for me to present the second edition of the book after the warm response of the first edition. There are always important new applications and examples on Waves and Oscillations. I have included many new problems and topics in the present edition. It is hoped that the present edition will be more useful and enjoyable to the students.
     I am very thankful to New Age International (P) Ltd., Publishers for their untiring effort to bringing out the book within a short period with a nice get up.

The purpose of this book is to present a comprehensive study of waves and oscillations in different fields of Physics. The book explains the basic concepts of waves and oscillations through the method of solving problems and it is designed to be used as a textbook for a formal course on the subject. Each chapter begins with the short but clear description of the basic concepts and principles. This is followed by a large number of solved problems of different types. The proofs of relevant theorems and derivations of basic equations are included among the solved problems. A large number of supplementary problems at the end of each chapter serves as a complete review of the theory. Hints are also provided in the case of relatively complex problems.
     The topics discussed include simple harmonic motion, superposition principle and coupled oscillations, damped harmonic oscillations, forced vibrations and resonance, waves, superposition of waves, Fourier analysis, vibrations of strings and membranes, Doppler effect, acoustics of buildings, electromagnetic waves, interference and diffraction. In all, 323 solved and 350 supplementary problems with answers are given in the book.
     This book will be of great help not only to B.Sc. (Honours and Pass) students of Physics, but also to those preparing for various competitive examinations.
     I thank Professor K.C. Gupta for going through the manuscripts carefully and for suggesting some new problems for making the book more interesting and stimulating.

1.1 PERIODIC MOTION
When a body repeats its path of motion back and forth about the equilibrium or mean position, the motion is said to be periodic. All periodic motions need not be back and forth like the motion of the earth about the sun, which is periodic but not vibratory in nature.

1.2 THE TIME PERIOD (T)
The time period of a vibrating or oscillatory system is the time required to complete one full cycle of vibration of oscillation.

1.3 THE FREQUENCY (?)
The frequency is the number of complete oscillations or cycles per unit time. If T is the time for one complete oscillation.
=  1	...(1.1)
T

1.4 THE DISPLACEMENT (X OR Y )
The displacement of a vibrating body is the distance from its equilibrium or mean position. The maximum displacement is called the amplitude.


1.5 RESTORING FORCE OR RETURN FORCE	W
The mass m lies on a frictionless horizontal surface. It is connected to one end of a spring of negligible mass and relaxed length a0, whose other end is fixed to a rigid wall W [Fig. 1.1 (a)].
If the mass m is given a displacement along the x-axis	W
and released [Fig. 1.1 (b)], it will oscillate back and forth in
a straight line along x-axis about the equilibrium position
O. Suppose at any instant of time the displacement of the mass is x from the equilibrium position. There is a force



x
O






O	x
(b)
Fig 1.1


tending to restore m to its equilibrium position. This force, called the restoring force or return force, is proportional to the displacement x when x is not large:

F  = -k x i^	...(1.2)
where k, the constant of proportionality, is called the spring constant or stiffness factor, and i^ is the unit vector in the positive x-direction. The minus sign indicates that the restoring force is always opposite in direction to the displacement.
By Newton's second law Eqn. (1.2) can be written as

m ?x?

= -kx or, ?x?

+ ??x = 0	...(1.3)

where ?? = k/m = return force per unit displacement per unit mass. ? is called the angular frequency of oscillation.

1.6 SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION (SHM)
If the restoring force of a vibrating or oscillatory system is proportional to the displacement of the body from its equilibrium position and is directed opposite to the direction of displace- ment, the motion of the system is simple harmonic and it is given by Eqn. (1.3). Let the initial

conditions be x = A and

x? = 0 at t = 0, then integrating Eqn. (1.3), we get
x(t) = A cos ?t	...(1.4)

where A, the maximum value of the displacement, is called the amplitude of the motion. If
T is the time for one complete oscillation, then
x(t + T) = x(t)
or	A cos ?(t + T) = A cos ?t
or	?T = 2?

or	T =   2?
?
and	=  1
T


= 2?
=  ?
2?



or,	? ? 2??.


...(1.5)

The general solution of Eqn. (1.3) is
                                 x(t) = C cos ?t + D sin ?t	...(1.6) where C and D are determined from the initial conditions. Euqation (1.6) can be written as
x(t) = A cos (?t - ?)	...(1.7)
where C = A cos ? and D = A sin ?. The amplitude for the motion described by Eqn. (1.7) is now A = (C2 + D2)1/2 and the angular frequency is ? which is uneffected by the initial conditions. The angle ? called the phase angle or phase constant or epoch is given by
? = tan-1 (D/C), where ? is chosen in the interval 0 ? ? ? 2?.

1.7 VELOCITY, ACCELERATION AND ENERGY OF A SIMPLE HARMONIC OSCILLATOR
From Eqn. (1.7), we find that the magnitude of the velocity v is
v = |-A ? sin(?t - ??? = A?(1 - x2/A2)1/2
or	v = ?(A2 - x2)1/2	...(1.8)




and the acceleration of the particle is
a =  ?x?


= - A?2 cos(?t - ?? = -?2x	...(1.9)

     We see that, in simple harmonic motion, the acceleration is proportional to the displace- ment but opposite in sign.
     If T is the kinetic energy, V the potential energy, then from the law of conservation of energy, in the absence of any friction-type losses, we have
                                     E = T + V = constant where E is the total energy of the oscillator.
Also, Force	F  = - ? V

or	? dV
dx

= -kx

or	V =  1 kx2 + c
2
or	V =  1 m?2A2cos2(?t - ?) + c	...(1.10)
where c is an arbitrary constant.
The kinetic energy of the oscillator is
T = 1 mx· 2 = 1 m?2A2 sin2(?t - ??	...(1.11)
	
2	2
If V = 0 when x = 0, then c = 0 and
E =  1 m 2A2	...(1.12)
2
(i) At the end points x = ? A,
The velocity of the particle v = 0,
Acceleration	a = ??A directed towards the mean position, kinetic energy T = 0
potential energy V = 1 m 2A2 = E
2
(ii) At the mid-point (x = 0),
v = ?A, a = 0, T = 1 m?2A2 = E, V = 0


(iii) At x = ? A

T = V =E/2.


1.8 REFERENCE CIRCLE
Suppose that the point Q is moving anticlockwise with uniform angular velocity ? along a circular path with O as the centre (Fig. 1.2). This circle is called the reference circle for simple harmonic motion. BOB? is any diameter of the circle. B?OB is chosen to be along the x-axis. From Q, a perpendicular QP is dropped on the diameter B?B. When Q moves with uniform angular velocity along the circular path, the point P executes simple harmonic motion along the diameter BB?. The amplitude of the back and forth motion of the point P


about the centre O is OB = the radius of the circle = A. Suppose Q is at B at time t = 0 and it takes a time t for going from B to Q and by this time the point P moves form B to P. If
? QOB = ?, t = ?/? or, ? ? ?t, and x = OP = OQ cos ? = A cos ?t.

Fig. 1.2
When Q completes one revolution along the circular path, the point P executes one complete oscillation. The time period of oscillation T = 2?/?. If we choose the circle in the xy plane, the position of Q at any time t is given by

r = A cos ?t i^ + A sin ?t ^j .

1.9 THE SIMPLE PENDULUM
The bob of the simple pendulum undergoes nearly SHM if its angle of swing is not large. The time period of oscillation of a simple pendulum of length l is given by

T =  2?
where g is the acceleration due to gravity.

...(1.13)


1.10 ANGULAR SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION (TORSIONAL PENDULUM)
A disc is suspended by a wire. If we twist the disc from its rest position and release it, it will oscillate about that position in angular simple harmonic motion. Twisting the disc through an angle ? in either direction, introduces a restoring torque
? = - C?	...(1.14)
and the period of angular simple harmonic oscillator or torsional pendulum is given by
T = 2?	...(1.15)
where I is the rotational inertia of the oscillating disc about the axis of rotation and C is the restoring torque per unit angle of twist.



     1. A point is executing SHM with a period ?s. When it is passing through the centre of its path, its velocity is 0.1 m/s. What is its velocity when it is at a distance of 0.03 m from the mean position?
Solution
     When the point is at a distance x from the mean position its velocity is given by Eqn. (1.8):
v = ?(A2 - x2)1/2.
Its time period, T = ???? ? ?; thus ? = 2 s-1. At x = 0, v = A? = 0.1; thus A = 0.05 m.
When x = 0.03 m, v = 2 [(0.05)2 - (0.03)2]1/2 = 0.08 m/s.
     2. A point moves with simple harmonic motion whose period is 4 s. If it starts from rest at a distance 4.0 cm from the centre of its path, find the time that elapses before it has described 2 cm and the velocity it has then acquired. How long will the point take to reach the centre of its path?
Solution
     Amplitude A = 4 cm and time period T = 2??? = 4 s. The distance from the centre of the path x = 4-2 = 2 cm. Since x = A cos ?t, we have 2 = 4 cos ?t. Hence t = 2/3 s and the

velocity v = ?
= ?/2 or, t = 1 s.

= ?/2

= ?

cm/s. At the centre of the path x = 0 and ?t

     3. A mass of 1 g vibrates through 1 mm on each side of the middle point of its path and makes 500 complete vibrations per second. Assuming its motion to be simple harmonic, show that the maximum force acting on the particle is ?2 N.
Solution
A = 1 mm = 10-3 m, ? = 500 Hz and ? = 2??. Maximum acceleration = ??A.
Maximum force = m?2A = 10-3 × 4?2 (500)2 × 10-3 = 2 ??N.
     4. At t = 0, the displacement of a point x (0) in a linear oscillator is -8.6 cm, its velocity v (0) = - 0.93 m/s and its acceleration a (0) is + 48 m/s2. (a) What are the angular frequency
? and the frequency ? ? (b) What is the phase constant? (c) What is the amplitude of the motion?
Solution
(a) The displacement of the particle is given by
x(t) = A cos(?t + ?)
Hence,	x(0) = A cos ? = - 8.6 cm = - 0.086 m
v(0) = -?A sin ? = - 0.93 m/s
a(0) = -?2A cos ? = 48 m/s2


Thus,	? =

?

= 23.62 rad/s



? = ?/2? = 23.62

= 3.76 Hz

(c) A =  xb0g
cos ?

? ??0.086 . cos ?

     The amplitude of the motion is a positive constant. So, ? = 335.4° cannot be the correct phase. We must therefore have

? = 155.4°
A =  ??0.086
?0.909

     5. A point performs harmonic oscillations along a straight line with a period T = 0.8 s and an amplitude A = 8 cm. Find the mean velocity of the point averaged over the time interval during which it travels a distance A/2, starting from (i) the extreme position, (ii) the equilibrium position.
Solution
We have
x(t) = A cos(?t - ?)
(i) The particle moves from x = A to x = A/2,
or	?t - ? = 0 to ?t - ? = ?? ,

or	t = ?? to t = ?? ? ? ?  .

6. A particle performs harmonic oscillations along the x-axis according to the law
x = A cos ? t.
Assuming the probability P of the particle to fall within an interval from -A to A to be equal to unity, find how the probability density dP/dx depends on x. Here dP denotes the probability of the particle within the interval from x to x + dx.
Solution
The velocity of the particle at any time t is
x? = - A? sin ?t.
Time taken by the particle in traversing a distance from x to x + dx is
dx	=	dx	?	dx	.

Time taken by the particle in traversing the distance -A to A is T/2.

Thus,	dP =	1

     7. In a certain engine a piston executes vertical SHM with amplitude 2 cm. A washer rests on the top of the piston. If the frequency of the piston is slowly increased, at what frequency will the washer no longer stay in contact with the piston?
Solution
     The maximum downward acceleration of the washer = g. If the piston accelerates downward greater than this, this washer will lose contact.
The largest downward acceleration of the piston
= ?2A = ?2 × 0.02 m/s2.
     The washer will just separate from the piston when	?2 × 0.02 = g = 9.8 m/s2.


Thus,	? = ??  ?	? 3.52 2?

     8. A light spring of relaxed length a0 is suspended from a point. It carries a mass m at its lower free end which stretches it through a distance l. Show that the vertical oscillations
of the system are simple harmonic in nature and have time period, T = 2?  l g .


Solution
The spring is elongated through a distance l due to the weight mg. Thus we have
kl = mg
where k is the spring constant. Now the mass is further pulled through a small distance from its equilibrium position and released. When it is at a distance x from the mean position (Fig. 1.3), the net upward force on the mass m is
k(l + x) - mg = kx = mgx/l.
     Upward acceleration = gx/l = ??x, which is proportional to x and directed opposite to the direction of increasing x. Hence the motion is simple harmonic and its time period of oscillation is
 2?
T =  ? = 2?
Note: Young's modulus of the material of the wire is
given by	m
Y = mg /(l/L) = mgL ,
	
A	Al

where L is the length of the wire and A is the cross-sec- tional area of the wire.

Thus, mg

     9. A 100 g mass vibrates hori/ontally without friction at the end of an hori/ontal spring for which the spring constant is 10 N/m. The mass is displaced 0.5 cm from its equilibrium and released. Find: (a) Its maximum speed, (b) Its speed when it is 0.3 cm from equilibrium.
(c) What is its acceleration in each of these cases?
Solution

(a) ? =

=

= 10 s-1 and A = 0.005 m.

The maximum speed = A? = 0.05 m/s

(b) |?| = ?

= 0.04 m/s

(c) Acceleration a = - ?x
(i) At x = 0, a = 0
(ii) At x = 0.3 cm, a = -0.03 m/s2.
     10. A mass M attached to a spring oscillates with a period of 2 s. If the mass is increased by 2 kg, the period increases by one second. Find the initial mass M assuming that Hooke's law is obeyed.	(I.I.T. 1979)
Solution
Since T = 2? m k , we have in the first case 2 = 2?	and in the second case
3 = 2?	. Solving for M from these two equations we get M = 1.6 kg.


     11. Two masses m1 and m2 are suspended together by a massless spring of spring constant k as shown in Fig. 1.4. When the masses are in equilibrium, m1 is removed without disturbing the system. Find the angular frequency and amplitude of oscillation.(I.I.T. 1981)
Solution
     When only the mass m2 is suspended let the elongation of the spring be x1. When both the masses (m2 + m1) together are suspended, the elongation of the spring is (x1 + x2).
Thus, we have

m2 g = kx1
                          (m1 + m2)g = k(x1 + x2) where k is the spring constant.
Hence	m1g = kx2.
     Thus, x2 is the elongation of the spring due to the mass m1 only. When the mass m1 is removed the mass m2 executes SHM with the amplitude x2.
Amplitude of vibration =	x2 = m1g/k
Angular frequency	? =  k m2 .
     12. The 100 g mass shown in Fig. 1.5 is pushed to the left against a light spring of spring constant k = 500 N/m and com- presses the spring 10 cm from its relaxed position. The system is then released and the mass shoots to the right. If the friction is ignored how fast will the mass be moving as it shoots away?

     13. In Fig. 1.6 the 1 kg mass is released when the spring is unstretched (the spring constant k = 400 N/m). Neglecting the inertia and friction of the pulley, find (a) the amplitude of the resulting oscillation, (b) its centre point of oscillation, and
(c) the expressions for the potential energy and the kinetic energy of the system at a distance y downward from the centre point of oscillation.

     (a) Suppose the mass falls a distance h before stopping. The spring is elongated by h. At this moment the gravitational potential energy (mgh) the mass lost is stored in the spring.

     After falling a distance h the mass stops momentarily, its kinetic energy T = 0 at that moment and the PE of the system V = 1/2 kh2, and then it starts moving up. The mass will stop in its upward motion when the energy of the system is recovered as the gravitational PE (mgh). Therefore, it will rise 0.049 m above its lowest position. The amplitude of oscil- lation is thus 0.049/2 = 0.0245 m.
     (b) The centre point of motion is at a distance h/2 = 0.0245 m below the point from where the mass was released.
(c) Total energy of the system

Find the period of motion for each system. Ignore frictional forces.
Solution
     (a) When the mass m is given a displacement x, one spring will be elongated by x, and the other will be compressed by x. They will each exert a force of magnitude kx on the mass
in the direction opposite to the displacement. Hence, the total restoring force F = -2 kx = m ?x?. So,

If k is the equivalent spring constant of the combination (b), we have

Thus,	k = k1 + k2.

     At the equilibrium position each spring has tension T0 = k(a - a0). Let at any instant of time x be the displacement of the mass from the equilibrium position. At that time the net force on the mass due to two springs in the +ve x-direction is
Fx = - k(a + x - a0) + k(a - x - a0) = - 2kx.
Thus,	m ?x? = -2kx and ?2 = 2k/m
and	T = 2? m ?2k?.
     21. A mass m is suspended between rigid supports by means of two identical springs. The springs each have /ero mass, spring constant k, and relaxed length a0.

Solution
     At equilibrium each spring exerts tension T0 = k (a - a0). In the general configuration (Fig. 1.13(b)) each spring has length l and tension T = (l - a0) which is exerted along CA or CB. The y-component of this force is -T sin ?. Each spring contributes a return force T sin

The spring is compressed to half its length and then released. Determine the kinetic energy of the body, and its maximum value, in the ensuing motion in the presence of the gravitational field.
Solution
     If the position of the body is measured from the relaxed position of the spring by the coordinate y (positive upward) and if the P.E. V is set equal to zero at y = 0, we have

     A small bob of mass m is attached to one end of a string of negligible mass and the other end of the string is rigidly fixed at O (Fig. 1.15). OA is the vertical position of the sim- ple pendulum of length l and this is also the equilibrium position of the system. The pendulum can oscillate only in the vertical plane and at any instant of time B is the position of the bob. Let ?AOB = ?.

     The return force acting on the bob along the tangent BN drawn at B to the circular arc AB is mg sin ?. There is no component of the tension T of the string along BN. The return force mg sin ? acts in a direction opposite to the direction of increasing ?. Thus we have

     When the pendulum is at an angle ? with the vertical [Fig. 1.18(b)], the pendulum is raised by the distance h = L - L cos ? and the PE of the pendulum is
(P.E.)m = mgh = mgL(1 - cos ?).
The zero level of the PE is chosen with the pendulum being vertical.
     When the pendulum is at an angle ?, one of the springs is stretched by the amount a?, while the other is compressed by the same amount. The PE of the springs is

minimum number of collisions after which the amplitude of oscillation becomes less than 60°?	(I.I.T. 1987)

     Let v0 be the velocity of the bob just before the first collision.

Then

1

We assume that after n collisions the amplitude of oscillation becomes 60°.




Thus,

n is slightly greater than 3. In fact
n =		log10 2 log10 5 ? log10 4

     Thus the minimum number of collisions after which the amplitude becomes less than 60° is 4.

At the highest point of its trajectory, it collides head-on with a bob of mass 3 M suspended by a massless string of length 10/3 m and gets embedded in the bob. After the collision the string moves through an angle of 120°. Find
(i) the angle ?
(ii) the vertical and hori/ontal coordinates of the initial position of the bob with respect to the point of firing of the bullet. (Take g = 10 m/s2)	(I.I.T 1988)

Solution
     (i) At the highest point of the bullet the horizontal component of velocity = u cos ? and the vertical component of velocity = 0. Let (x, y) be the coordinates of the initial position A of the bob (Fig. 1.20).
We have

     30. Two identical balls A and B each of mass 0.1 kg are attached to two identical massless springs. The spring-mass system is constrained to move inside a rigid smooth pipe bent in the form of a circle as shown in Fig. 1.21. The pipe is fixed in a hori/ontal plane. The centres of the balls can move in a circle of radius 0.06 metre. Each spring has a natural length


of 0.06 ? metre and spring constant 0.1 N/m. Initially, both the balls are displaced by an angle ? = ?6 radian with respect to the diameter PQ of the circle (as shown in the figure) and released from rest.

     31. If the earth were a homogeneous sphere of radius R and a straight hole were bored in it through its centre, show that a body dropped into the hole will execute SHM. Find its time period.
Solution
Suppose AB is a straight hole (Fig. 1.22) passing through	A
the centre O of the earth. A body of mass m is dropped into
the hole. At any instant of time the body is at C at a distance x from the centre of the earth. When the body is at C, the force of attraction on the body due to earth is
4	?m

                                    F = - G 3 ?x3 x2 where ?, density of the material of earth, is assumed to be uniform everywhere and G, the universal gravitational constant.
At C, the acceleration of the body towards the centre

     As a ? x and it acts opposite to the direction of increasing x, the motion of the body is simple harmonic. We have

where	M = mass of the earth.
Hence,	2 =	g

We have	T = 5077.6 s.
    32. A cylindrical piston of mass M slides smoothly inside a long cylinder closed at one end, enclosing a certain mass of gas. The cylinder is kept with its axis hori/ontal.

Solution
     Suppose that the initial pressure of the gas is P and initial volume is V = Ah. The piston is moved isothermally from C to D through a distance x (Fig. 1.23). The gas inside the cylinder will be compressed and it will try to push the piston to its original position. When the piston is at D let the pressure of the gas be P + ?P and volume = V - ?V
= V - Ax. Since the process is isothermal, we have

     33. An ideal gas is enclosed in a vertical cylindrical container and supports a freely moving piston of mass M. The piston and the cylinder have equal cross-sectional area A. Atmospheric pressure is P0 and when the piston is in equilibrium, the volume of the gas is V0. The piston is now displaced slightly from the equilibrium position. Assuming that the system is completely isolated from its surroundings, show that the piston executes simple harmonic motion and find the frequency of oscillation.	(I.I.T. 1981)
Solution
     Since the system is completely isolated from the surroundings, there will be adiabatic change in the container. Let the initial pressure and the volume of the gas be P and V0 respectively. When the piston is moved down a distance x, the pressure increases to P + ?P and volume decreases to V0 - ?V. Thus,
PV ?  = (P + ?P) (V0 - ?V)?

     34. Two non-viscous, incompressible and immiscible liquids of densities ? and 1.5 ? are poured into two limbs of a circular tube of radius R and small cross-section kept fixed in a vertical plane as shown in Fig. 1.24. Each liquid occu- pies one-fourth the circumference of the tube. (a) Find the angle ? that the radius vector to the interface makes with the vertical in equilibrium position. (b) If the whole liquid is given a small displacement from its equilibrium position, show that the resulting oscillations are simple harmonic. Find the time period of these oscillations.	(I.I.T. 1991)
Solution
     (a) Since each liquid occupies one-fourth the circumfer- ence of the tube, ?AOC = 90° = ?BOC [Fig. 1.25 (a)].
The pressure P1 at D due to liquid on the left limb is
P1 = (R - R sin?) 1.5 ?g
The pressure P2 at D due to liquid on the right limb is



















Fig. 1.24

P2 = (R - R cos ?) 1.5 ?g + (R sin ? + R cos ?)?g
At equilibrium P1 = P2. Thus, we have
(1 - sin ?) 1.5 = (1 - cos ?) 1.5 + sin ? + cos ?
Solving this equation, we get 2.5 sin ? = 0.5 cos ?,
or	tan	=  0.5 = 0.2

(b) When the liquid is given a small upward displacement y = BB? in the right limb [Fig.

dP = P2? - P1?
= [R - R cos(? + ?) 1.5 ?g + [R sin(? + ?)

? R?g {2.5 [sin ? + ? cos ?] - 0.5[cos ? - ? sin ?]}
= R?g {2.5? cos ? + 0.5? sin ?}
= y?g {2.5 cos ? + 0.5 sin ?}
= 2.55?gy
     Thus,	Restoring force = - 2.55 ?gy × A, where A is the area of cross-section of the tube.
Mass of the liquid in the tube is
m =  2?R A? ?  2?R A × 1.5? = 1.25 ?RA?.

The acceleration of the liquid column is

    35. Ten kg of mercury are poured into a glass U tube [Fig. 1.26]. The tube's inner diameter is 1.0 cm and the mercury oscillates freely up and down about its equilibrium
position (x = 0). Calculate (a) the effective spring constant of	2x
motion, and (b) the time period. Ignore frictional and surface
tension effects.
Solution
     (a) When the mercury is displaced x metres from its equilibrium position in the right arm, the restoring force is due to the weight of the unbalanced column of mercury of weight 2x. Now,

Weight = Volume × Density × g
= (?r22x) × ? × g

Fig. 1.26

where	? = 13.6 g/cm3 =

10-6 m 3

= 13.6 × 103 kg/m3.

     Thus, the restoring force = - (2?r2 ?g) x, and Hooke's law is valid, thereby we see that the effective spring constant for the system is
k = 2?r2 ?g = 2?(0.005)2 (13.6 × 103) × 9.8

Solution
     (a) Let D and O represent the position of the end of the spring before and after the object is put (Fig. 1.29). Position O is the equilibrium position of the object. The positive /-axis is downward with origin at the equilibrium position O. When the elongation of the spring is 0.1 m, the force on it is 98 N.

(b) The general solution of the differential equation is
x = C cos 3t + D sin 3t.
The initial conditions are x = 8, x? = 0 at t = 0, which give C = 8 and D = 0.
Thus,	x = 8 cos 3t

(a) to the right with speed 18 units, (b) to the left with speed 18 units. Find the amplitude, frequency and the phase angle in each case. Are the two motions (a) and (b) 180° out of phase with each other?
Solution
(a) x = C cos 3t + D sin 3t.
At t = 0, x = 8 and x? = 18, which give C = 8 and D = 6.
Thus,	x = 8 cos 3t + 6 sin 3t

     The amplitude and frequency are the same as in part (a). The only difference is in the phase angle. Here we have sin (? + ?) = 0 and cos (? + ?) = 1 and ? + ? = 2?. The two motions are not 180° out of phase with each other since ? - ? ? 180°.

     Let l be the length of the coiled wire of the spring. Let the suspended mass m be at a distance / from the equilibrium position. We consider an element of length dx of the spring situated between points x and x + dx measured along the spring from the point of support. Since the stretching is assumed to be uniform, the element, distant x from the fixed end, will experience a displacement (x/l) / and will have velocity (x l) /?. Since the mass of the element

     Note that this line of reasoning leads to a general result: Any conservative system will oscillate with SHM about a minimum in its potential energy curve provided the oscillation amplitude is small enough.

     The equation of motion is ? = I?, where ? is the external torque, I is the moment of inertia, ? is the angular accelera- tion, and both ? and I are about the pivot point. Let ? be a small angular displacement from the vertical. Now, external torque comes both from the rod and the disc:

The rod is free to rotate in a vertical plane about a hori/ontal axis passing through P. The density d1 of the material of the rod is smaller than the density d2 of the liquid. The rod is dis- placed by a small angle ? from its equilibrium position and then released. Show that the motion of the rod is simple harmonic and determine its angular frequency in terms of the given parameters.	(I.I.T. 1996)

Solution
     Volume of the rod, V = SL and its mass, M = Vd1 = SLd1. In the slightly displaced position two forces are acting on the rod:
Downward force due to gravity, Fg = Mg = SLd1 g. Upward force due to buoyancy, FB = Vd2g = SLd2 g.
     Since d2 > d1, a net upward force of magnitude FB - Fg acts at O (the middle point of the rod).

[Such a beam is called a loaded cantilever.] If the loaded free end of the beam is slightly displaced from its equilibrium position, it starts executing SHM. Find an expression for the time period of vibration of the loaded light cantilever.
Solution
     We shall assume that the bar is not subjected to any tension and the amplitude of motion is so small that the rotatory effect can be neglected.

       In the bent position of the rod we consider a cross-section ABCD of a small segment of the rod of length ?x measured along the central line PQ so that
EQ = EP = R = radius of curvature of the central	A	B
filament PQ (Fig. 1.34). The filaments above PQ are	M	N

If Y denotes the Young's modulus of the material of the beam, the longitudinal stress

The total energy in the circuit is the sum of the magnetic and electric energy:
E = E  + E  = 1 LI2 + 1 q2

where I = Current and q = Capacitor charge.

Since the total energy does not change, dE

which describes the capacitor charge as a function of time. The solution of this equation is

The whole system is kept on a frictionless hori/ontal surface with the string held tight so that each mass is at a distance a from the centre P (as shown in the Figure 1.38). Now the mid-point of the string is pulled verti- cally upwards with a small but constant force F. As a result, the particles move towards each other on the surface.

(d) 1 mm	0.1s	50	1 mm
(I.I.T. 2006)
Solution
     The error in T decreases with increase in the number of oscillations (n). The amplitude should be small for SHM of the simple pendulum. In (D), we have minimum error in l (?l = 1 mm) and T (?T = 0.1s).
Correct choice: (d).

If at a height y* from the mean position the body gets detached from the spring, calculate the value of y* so that the height H attained by the mass is maximum. The body does not interact with the spring during its subsequent motion after the detachment (a?2 > g).
(b) Find the maximum value of H.	(I.I.T. 2005)

      where k is the spring constant and ?2 = (k/m) The amplitude of oscillation a is greater than l. Now if the mass is pulled down through a distance from the equilib- rium position A (Fig. 1.40) and released from rest it
executes SHM about the mean position. When the mass	y* is moving up, suppose, it is at the position C at a distance y* from the mean position. At this position P.E.

     Suppose, when the mass is moving up at C, it gets detached from the spring, and due to its K.E. It goes further up by a height h so that the K.E. of the mass at C = mgh.
Thus, we have
E =  1 k (y* - l)2 + mgy* + mgh = 1 k (a2 + l2)

     64. A particle of mass m moves on the x-axis as follows: it starts from rest at t = 0 from the point x = 0 and comes to rest at t = 1 at the point x = 1. No other information is available about its motion at intermediate times (0 < t < 1). If ? denotes the instantaneous acceleration of the particle, then
(a) ? cannot remain positive for all t in the interval (0 ? t ? 1).
(b) |?| cannot exceed 2 at any point in its path.
(c) |?| must be ? 4 at some point or points in its path.
(d) ? must change sign during the motion, but no other assertion can be made with the information given.	(I.I.T. 1993)
Solution
We may consider a motion of the type
x = x0 + A cos ?t

so that
Again,

x? = - A? sin ?t = 0 at time t = 0
x? = 0 at time t = 1

or	sin ? = 0 or ? = ?, 2?, 3?, ...
? cannot be zero. In that case x becomes independent of t. Thus the equation of motion of the particle is
x = x0 + A cos n?t, n = 1, 2, 3, ...
At t = 0, x = 0 and t = 1, x = 1,
x0 = - A

66. A particle free to move along the x-axis has potential energy given by
U(x) = k [1 - exp (- x2)], - ? ? x ? ?
where k is a positive constant dimensions. Then
(a) At points away from the origin, the particle is in unstable equilibrium.
(b) For any finite non-/ero value of x, there is a force directed away from the origin.
(c) If its total mechanical energy is k2 , it has its minimum kinetic energy at the origin.
(d) For small displacement from x = 0, the motion is simple harmonic.	(I.I.T. 1999)
Solution

Force =  - dU
dx

= - 2kx e-x2

The -ve sign indicates that the force is directed towards the origin. For small x, Force = - 2kx, the motion is simple harmonic.
For small x, U(x) ? k [1 - 1 + x2] = kx2.
Minimum P.E. is at x = 0 and thus the maximum K.E. is at x = 0.

     68. Two blocks A and B each of mass m are connected by a massless spring of natural length L and spring constant K. The blocks are initially resting on a smooth hori/ontal floor with the spring at its natural length as shown in Fig. 1.42.



V	L

Fig. 1.42
A third identical block C also of mass m, moves on the floor with a speed V along the line joining A and B and collides with A. Then
(a) the kinetic energy of the A-B system at maximum compression of the spring, is /ero,
(b) the kinetic energy of the A-B system at maximum compression of the spring is
mV 24 .
(c) the maximum compression of the spring is V m K .

(d) the maximum compression of the spring is V m 2K.	(I.I.T. 1993)
Solution
     The block C will come to rest after colliding with the block A and its energy will be partly converted to the K.E. of the A-B system and the remaining energy goes into the internal energy of the A-B system.
     Suppose, V? = Velocity of the A-B system after the collision. From the principle of conservation of momentum, we get
mV = 2mV?	or,	V? = V
2
     At the maximum compression of the spring the internal energy is the potential energy of the spring. The A-B system moves with velocity V? after the collision. Thus, the kinetic energy of the A-B system is
1	J V 72	mV 2

The P.E. of the A-B system is

If x is the maximum compression of the spring, then

2.1 DEGREES OF FREEDOM
Number of independent coordinates required to specify the configuration of a system completely is known as degrees of freedom.

2.2 SUPERPOSITION PRINCIPLE
For a linear homogeneous differential equation, the sum of any two solutions is itself a solution.
Consider a linear homogeneous differential equation of degree n:
a  dn y ? a	dn?1 y ? .... ? a dy ? a y ? 0.
n dtn	n?1 dtn?1	1 dt	0
     If y1 and y2 are two solutions of this equation then y1 + y2 is also a solution, which can be proved by direct substitution.

2.3 SUPERPOSITION PRINCIPLE FOR LINEAR INHOMOGENEOUS EQUATION
Consider a driven harmonic oscillator
m d2 x ? ?kx ? F(t) 
dt2
where F(t) is the external force which is independent of x. Suppose that a driving force
F1(t) produces an oscillation x1 (t) and another driving force F2(t) produces an oscillation
x2 (t) [when F2(t) is the only driving force]. When the total driving force is F1(t) + F2(t), the corresponding oscillation is given by x(t) = x1(t) + x2(t).

2.4 SUPERPOSITION OF SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTIONS ALONG A STRAIGHT LINE
If a number of simple harmonic motions along the x-axis
xi = ai sin (?it + ?i), i = 1, 2, .., N	...(2.1)


are superimposed on a particle simultaneously, the resultant motion is given by
X =  ? xi = ? ai sin(?it + ?i).	(2.2)

2.5 SUPERPOSITION OF TWO SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTIONS AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER
If two simple harmonic motions
x = a sin ?1t,	...(2.3)
y = b sin(?2t + ?)	...(2.4)
act on a particle simultaneously perpendicular to each other the particle describes a path known as Lissajous figure when ?1 and ?2 are in simple ratio. The equation of the path is obtained by eliminating t from these two equations. The position of the particle in the xy plane is given by

1. Two simple harmonic motions of same angular frequency ?
x1 = a1 sin ?t,
x2 = a2 sin (?t + ?)
act on a particle along the x-axis simultaneously. Find the resultant motion.
Solution
The resultant displacement is
X = x1+ x2 = sin ?t [a1 + a2 cos ?] + cos ?t [a2 sin ?].

We put



so that


R cos ? = a1 + a2 cos ?,	...(2.6)
R sin? = a2 sin ?	...(2.7)

R2 =  a2 + a2 + 2a a cos ?	...(2.8)
1	2	1 2

and	tan ? =	a2 sin ?
a1 ? a2 cos ?

...(2.9)

The resultant displacement is
X = R sin(?t + ?)	...(2.10)
which is also simple harmonic along the x-axis with the same angular frequency ?. The amplitude R and the phase angle ? of the resultant motion are given by Eqns. (2.8) and (2.9) respectively.
Special Cases
(i) ? = + 2 n?, n = 0, 1, 2,.... or, the two SHMs x1 and x2 are in phase,


R = a1 + a2
(ii) ? = + (2n + 1)?, n = 0, 1, 2,...or, the two SHMs x1 and x2 are in opposite phase,
R = a1 ~ a2.
     In this case, the resultant amplitude is zero when a1 = a2 and one motion is destroyed by the other.
     2. Find the resultant motion due to superposition of a large number of simple harmonic motions of same amplitude and same frequency along the x-axis but differing progressively in phase.
Solution
The simple harmonic motions are given by
x1 = a sin ?t,
x2 = a sin(?t + ?),
x3 = a sin(?t + 2?),
§	§
xN = a sin[?t + ?N ????].
The resultant displacement is
X = ? xi = a sin ?t [1 + cos ? + cos 2? +...+ sin (N -1) ?],
i
+ a cos ?t [0 + sin ? + sin 2? +...+ sin (N -1) ?],
= R sin (?t + ?)	...(2.11)
where	R cos ? = a [1 + cos ? + cos 2? +.... + cos (N - 1) ?],
R sin ? = a [0 + sin ? + sin 2? +.... + sin (N - 1) ?]
ei? (e(N ?1)? ? 1

Now,	ei? + e2i? + ...... + ei(N - 1)? =

ei? ? 1
 iN? sin (N ? 1)? / 2

                                          sin ? / 2 Equating the real and imaginary parts, we get
cos ? + cos 2? +... + cos (N - 1) ? =   cos N ? / 2 sin (N ? 1)? / 2
sin ? / 2

sin ? + sin 2? +...+ sin (N - 1)? =  sin N ? / 2 sin(N ? 1) ? / 2
sin ? / 2
Thus, we write
1 + cos ? + cos 2? + ...+ cos (N - 1) ? = 1 + cos N? / 2 sin(N ? 1)? / 2
sin ? / 2
= sin{N ? (N ? 1)}? / 2 cos N? / 2 sin(N ? 1)? / 2
sin ? / 2
=  sin N? / 2 cos (N ? 1)? / 2
sin ? / 2


     The resultant motion of Eqn. (2.11) is simple harmonic with amplitude and phase angle given by

R = a sin(N? / 2)
sin(? / 2)

...(2.12)

? = (N - 1)?/2	...(2.13)
When N is large and ? is small, we may write
? ? N?/2,	...(2.14)

R ? Na sin ?

...(2.15)

and the phase difference between the first component vibration x1 and Nth component vibration
xN is nearly equal to 2?.
     The resultant amplitude may be obtained by the vector polygon method (Fig. 2.1). The polygon OABCD is drawn with each side of length a and making an angle ? with the neighbouring side. The resultant has the amplitude OD with the phase angle = ? DOA with respect to the first vibration.

Special Cases

     (i) We consider the special case when there is superposition of a large number of vibrations xi of very small amplitude a but continuously increasing phase. The polygon will then become an arc of a circle and the chord joining the first and the last points of the arc will represent the amplitude of the resultant vibration (Fig. 2.2). When the last component vibration is at A, the first and the last component vibration are in opposite phase and the amplitude of the resultant vibration = OA = diameter of the circle. When the last component vibration is at B, the first and the last component vibrations are in phase, the polygon becomes a complete circle and the amplitude of the resultant vibration is zero.

= sin1001t + sin 999t + 2 sin 1000t.
     4. Two simple harmonic motions of same frequency ? but having displacements in two perpendicular directions act simultaneously on a particle:
x = a sin (?t + ?1 )
and	y = b sin (?t + ?2 ).
Find the resultant motion for various values of the phase difference ? = ?1- ?2.
Solution

We have	x
a

+ cos ?t sin ?1,	...(2.16)

y
b  =	sin ?t cos ?2

+ cos ?t sin ?2

...(2.17)

     Multiplying Eqn. (2.16) by sin ?2 and Eqn. (2.17) by sin ?1 and subtracting the second from the first, we get
x sin ? -  y sin ?  = sin ?t sin (? - ? )	...(2.18)
a	2	b	1	2	1
     Similarly multiplying Eqn. (2.16) by cos ?2 and Eqn. (2.17) by cos ?1 and subtracting the second from the first, we obtain
x cos ? - y cos ?  = cos ?t sin (? - ? )	...(2.19)
a	2	b	1	1	2
Now squaring Eqns. (2.18) and (2.19) and adding, we obtain

x2	y2

2xy	y

a2 ? b2 ?

ab cos(?1 - ?2) = sin2 (?1 - ?2)	...(2.20)

This represents the general equation of an
ellipse. Thus, due to superposition of two simple  A	D
harmonic vibrations at right angles to each other, the displacement of the particle will be along a curve given by Eqn. (2.20).

We get the oblique ellipse (Fig. 2.7).
     The direction of rotation (clockwise or anticlockwise) of the particle may be obtained form the x- and y-motions of the particle when t is increased gradually. How the path of the particle with direction changes as ? is increased gradually is shown in Fig. 2.8.

     That the two cases ? = ?/2 and ? = 3?/2, although giving the same path, are physically different may be seen by graphical constructions. When ? = ?/2, we have
x = a cos (?t + ?2)
                               y = b sin (?t + ?2) When t = 0 x = a cos ?2 and y = b sin ?2.

When  ?t + ?2

= ?? , x = 0 and y = b.
2

When ?t + ?2 = ?, x = - a and y = 0.
Thus in this case the particle moves in the anticlockwise direction.
Similarly, it can be shown that the particle moves in the clockwise direction
when ? =  3? .

     7. In an experiment to obtain Lissajous' figures, one tuning fork is of 250 H/ and a circular figure occurs after five seconds. What deductions may be made about the frequency of the other tuning fork?
Solution
     The Lissajous' figures are repeated in 5s i.e. the second tuning fork gains or loses one vibration over the first one in 5s. Thus, the difference in frequencies = 1/5 = 0.2 Hz. Hence, the possible frequencies of the second tuning fork are (250 + 0.2) = 250.2 Hz or (250 - 0.2)
= 249.8 Hz.
     8. Two-dimensional harmonic oscillation: The mass m is free to move in the xy plane (Fig. 2.13) (a). It is connected to the rigid walls by two unstretched massless springs of spring constant, k1 oriented along the x-axis and by the unstretched massless springs of spring constant k2 oriented along the y-axis. The relaxed length of each spring is a. Discuss the motion of the mass in the xy plane in the small oscillation approximation.

In the general configuration [Fig. 2.13 (b)], we have

where we have neglected x2/a2, y2/a2 and xy/a2 terms in comparison with 1 in the small oscillation approximation. Similarly we may write
l2 ? a - x, l3 ? a - y, l4 ? a + y.
     The tension in the first spring of length l1 is T1 ? k1 (a+ x - a) = k1x. Magnitude of x-component of this tension is T1 cos ?1 ? T1 = kx1 since the angle ?1 made by l1 with the x-axis is small. The y-component of this tension is T1 sin ?1 ? 0. Thus we find that the x-component of the return force is entirely due to the two springs of lengths l1 and l2:
Fx = - 2 k1x.
The y-component of the return force is also entirely due to the two springs of lengths
l3 and l4;
Fy = - 2 k2y.
Thus we get two uncoupled differential equations for the mass m along the x- and
y-directions:

m ?x? m ?y?

= -2 k1 x,
= -2 k2 y.

The solutions of these two equations are
x = A cos(? t + ? )	with ?2 = 2k /m,

y = B cos(? t + ? )	with ?2 = 2k /m.

     The complete motion can be thought of as the superposition of the motions xi ? yj . The position of the mass in the xy plane is given by

     9. The spherical pendulum: Consider a simple pendulum of length l. At equilibrium the string is vertical along the /-axis and the bob is at x = 0, y = 0. Find the motion of the bob for small oscillations (x and y are small).
Solution
     Suppose A is the position of the bob at any instant of time (Fig. 2.14). From A we drop a perpendicular AB on the /-axis. We have
AB2 = l2 -(l - /)2
= 2l/	- /2
Again,	/2 + AB2 = OA2 = x2 + y2 + /2
Thus,	2l/ = x2 + y2 + /2. Since / is a small quantity, we may write
/ ?  x2 ? y2
2l


which shows that / is a small quantity of second order. The potential energy of the bob at
A is
V = mg/	 mg (x2 + y2).

m ?x? m ?y?

These are simple harmonic motions. These equation can be solved independently:
x = A1 cos(?t + ?1),
y = A2 cos(?t + ?2)
with ?2 = g/l.
     The constants A1, A2, ?1 and ?2 are determined by the initial conditions of displacement and velocity in the x-and y-directions. The complete motion can be thought of as a superposition
of the motions i^x and j^y when we neglect the motion in the /-direction. Depending on the phase relationship between ?1 and ?2 we get an ellipse or a straight line for the path of the bob. For the x- and y-modes of vibrations we have the same frequency ?; the two modes are then said to be 'degenerate'.


10. Consider two coupled first order linear homogeneous differential equations
?x?1 = - a11x1 - a12 x2,	...(2.27)
?x?2 = - a21x1 - a22 x2	...(2.28)
     where a11, a12, a21 and a22 are constants. Find the angular frequencies for the normal modes of oscillations and the normal coordinates.
Solution
     For normal modes of oscillations, both the degrees of freedom, namely x1 and x2 oscillate with the same frequency and they oscillate in phase or out of phase with one another:
x1 = A exp (i?t),	...(2.29)
x2 = B exp (i?t)	...(2.30)
where A and B are in general complex to take account of the possibility that x1 and x2
might oscillate out of phase with one another.
Substituting Eqns. (2.29) and (2.30) into Eqns. (2.27) and (2.28), we get
(a11 - ?2) A + a12B = 0,	(2.31)
a21A + (a22 - ?2) B = 0.	(2.32)
For non-trivial solutions, we have
(a11 - ?2) (a22 - ?2) - a12a21 = 0.	(2.33)
This is a quadratic equation in the variable ?2. It has two solutions in general, which
we call ?2 and ?2 . From Eqn. (2.31), we find the ratio B/A as
1	2
B	?2 ? a

For normal mode 1 with ?2= ?2 , we may write
x1(t) = A1 exp (i?1t)
?2 ? a

x2(t) = A1

a12

11 exp (i?1t),

?2 ? a

x2(t) = A2

2	11
a12

exp (i?2t).

Due to superposition of the two modes the general solution is given by
x1(t) = A1 exp (i?1t) + A2 exp (i?2t),

x (t) =	1  [A ( ?2 - a

where A1 and A2 are arbitrary constants and ?1 and ?2 are the normal mode frequencies.
     Normal coordinates: If the differential equations are coupled, we have to search for new variables which satisfy uncoupled differential equations. The new variables are then called normal coordinates. Suppose X and Y are the normal coordinates satisfying the differential equations




X?? Y??

= - ?2 X,	...(2.35)
= - ?2 Y	(2.36)

     If X and Y are the normal coordinates, then any constant multiple of X and Y also satisfy Eqns. (2.35) and (2.36). Suppose X and Y are obtained from the linear combinations of x1 and x2 so that we may write
X = x1 + ?x2,	...(2.37)
Y = x1 + ?x2	...(2.38)
where ? and ? are constants. By solving x1 and x2, we get
x  = ??Y ? ?X ,	...(2.39)
1	? ? ?
x  =   X ? Y	(2.40)
2	? ? ?
     We substitute Eqns. (2.39) and (2.40) into Eqns. (2.27) and (2.28) and separate the uncoupled differential equations for X and Y, which give

?2  =  ?a11 ? a12 = a

Thus ? and ? satisfy the same quadratic equation having the roots

When a22 = a11 and a12 = a21, ??? = +1 and the normal coordinates are x1 + x2 and
x1 - x2.
     11. Longitudinal oscillations of two coupled masses: Two bodies of masses m1 and m2 are attached to each other and to two fixed points by three identical light springs of relaxed length a. The whole arrangement rests on a smooth hori/ontal table. Find the angular frequencies of the normal modes for longitudinal oscillations of small amplitude. Describe the motions of the two bodies for each normal mode. Find normal coordinates when m1 = m2.
Solution
     Let the spring constant of each spring be k. We consider the forces acting on m1 and m2 when m1 is displaced from its equilibrium position by x1 and m2 is displaced by x2 from its equilibrium position (Fig. 2.15). The first spring is stretched by amount x1 and the force


(a)





(b)


Fig. 2.15


on the mass m1 due to the first spring = - kx1. Length of the second spring = (2a + x2) - (a + x1) = a + x2 - x1. The second spring is stretched by x2 - x1. The force on the mass m1 due to the second spring = k (x2 - x1) and the force on the mass m2 due to the second spring
= -k (x2 - x1). The third spring is compressed by amount x2. Force on mass m2 due to the third spring = -kx2. So the equations of motion of the two bodies are

m1 ?x?1 m2 ?x?2

= - kx1+ k(x2 - x1),	...(2.43)
= - k(x2 - x1) - kx2	(2.44)

For normal modes of oscillations we put
x1 = A exp (i?t),	...(2.45)
x2 = B exp (i?t).	(2.46)
Substituting the solutions (2.45) and (2.46) into (2.43) and (2.44), we get
-m1?2A = -2kA + kB,	(2.47)
-m2?2B = kA - 2kB	(2.48)
or, in the matrix notation we may write

Jm ?2 ? 2k	k	7 J A7

J07

j 1	j j

j = j j

H	k	m2?2 ? 2kJ H BJ

jH0jJ

For non-trivial solutions we have (m1?2 - 2k) (m2?2 - 2k) - k2 = 0.
This is a quadratic equation in ?2 which can be solved to give

?2 =   k	 rjm ? m ? m2 ? m2 ? m m

yj	...(2.49)

m1m2 L 1	2	1
From Eqn. (2.48) we find the ratio A/B as

2	1  2 Q

A  =  2k ? m2?2
B	k

...(2.50)

Mode 1: The lower frequency solution of (2.49) has the ratio
A	m1 ? m2 ?  m2 ? m2 ? m1m2
	1	2	
B	m1
which is real and positive. The two bodies oscillate in phase.
Mode 2: The higher frequency solution of (2.49) has the ratio
A	m1 ? m2 ?  m2 ? m2 ? m1m2
	1	2	
B	m1
which is real and negative. The two bodies oscillate in antiphase.

Let us take the simple case m1

= m2

= m. The mode with lower frequency (?2 = k/m)

has the ratio A/B = 1 and therefore x1 = x2 for all time. The central spring has the same length as it had at equilibrium, so that the central spring exerts no force on either mass. When the left hand mass goes to the right, the right hand mass also goes to the right; when the left hand mass goes to the left, the right hand mass also goes to the left, the length of the central spring remaining unchanged always.


When m1 = m2 = m, the mode with higher frequency ( ?2  = 3 k/m) has the ratio
A/B = -1 so that x1 = - x2 for all time. When the left hand mass goes to the right, the right hand mass goes to the left [the central spring is compressed]. When the left hand mass goes to the left, the right hand mass to the right [the central spring is elongated]. The two masses move in opposite directions (antiphase). When the central spring is compressed, the side springs are elongated, and when the central spring is elongated, the side springs are
compressed.

Normal coordinates: When m1 = m2 = m, the lower frequency ?1 =

and higher

frequency ?2 =	3k / m . By adding Eqns. (2.43) and (2.44) and subtracting Eqn. (2.44) from Eqn. (2.43), we get
?x?1 + ?x?2 = - ?2 (x + x )
1	1	2
?x?1 - ?x?2 = - ?2 (x - x )
2  1	2
which show that the normal coordinates are x1+ x2 and x1- x2 having frequencies ?1 and ?2
respectively.
     12. Two bodies of masses m1 and m2 are attached to each other and to two fixed points by three identical light springs of relaxed length a0. Find the angular frequencies of the normal modes for transverse oscillations. Describe the motions of the two bodies for each normal mode. Find the normal coordinates when m1 = m2 = m.
Solution
     At equilibrium let the length of each spring be a and the spring constant be k. Let y1 and y2 be the vertical displacements of the masses m1 and m2 from the initial positions at any instant of time (Fig. 2.16). In this position the lengths of the springs are given by
l2  =  y2 + a2,
1	1
l2  = (y2 - y1)2 + a2,
l2  =  y2 + a2.
3	2
m2
Fig. 2.16


     Elongation of the left hand spring = l1 - a0 and the component of the force due to this spring on mass m1 along the y-direction = -k(l - a0) y1/l1. The central spring is elongated by (l2 - a0) and the component of the force due to the central spring on mass m1 along the y-direction is k (l2 - a0) (y2 - y1)/l2. The component of the force along the y-direction for mass
m2 due to the central and the right hand springs is
-k(l2- a0) (y2- y1)/l2 - k(l3- a0)y2/l3.
Thus, the equations of motion of the two masses are
J	a0 7	J	a0 7
m1 ?y?1 = -ky1 jH1 ? l jJ + k(y2 - y1) jH1 ? l jJ ,	...(2.51)

     (i) Slinky approximation: a0 is small and a0/l1, a0/l2, a0/l3<<1. Under this approximation Eqns. (2.51) and (2.52) reduce to
m1 ?y?1 = -2ky1 + ky2,	...(2.53)
m2 ?y?2 = ky1 - 2ky2,	...(2.54)
which are identically same as Eqns. (2.43) and (2.44) of problem 11. Thus the normal mode frequencies are given by Eqn. (2.49). When m1 = m2 = m, the two normal mode frequencies

are

and

with normal coordinates y1 + y2 and y1 - y2. For the mode with lower

frequency we get y1 = y2 i.e. the centre spring is never compressed or elongated. For the mode with higher frequency we have y1 = -y2 i.e. the two masses move in opposite directions.
(ii) Small oscillation approximation: When y1 and y2 are small in comparison with a, we

have

J	y2 7

Under this approximation Eqns. (2.51) and (2.52) become

     13. Two identical simple pendulums having the same length l and same bob mass m are suspended by strings of negligible mass. The bobs are connected by a spring of relaxed length
a. At the equilibrium position the spring has its relaxed length. Assuming small-oscillation amplitudes in the vertical plane, find the normal modes of oscillations of the system.
Solution
     At the general configuration (Fig. 2.17) the bobs are displaced by x1 and x2 from their equilibrium positions, where x1 and x2 are small. If the spring were not present, we have for the x-component of motion of the spherical pendulums.

     Due to coupling by the spring the force due to the spring will act on the bobs. Length of the spring in the general configuration = (a + x2 - x1). Elongation of the spring
= (a + x2 - x1) - a = x2 - x1. Thus the equations of motion for the coupled pendulums are

The normal mode frequencies are given by ?2 = g/l and ?2 = g/l + 2k/m with the normal
1	2
coordinates x1 + x2 and x1 - x2. For the mode with lower frequency ?1 we get x1= x2 i.e. the spring is never compressed or elongated and the whole system moves with the pendulum
frequency  g / l . For the mode with the higher frequency ?2 we have x1= - x2 i.e. the two bobs move in the opposite directions and the spring is alternately compressed and elongated.


14. Discuss the formation of beats due to superposition of two harmonic oscillations ?1
and ?2 having slightly different angular frequencies ?1 and ?2:
?1 = A cos ?1t,
?2 = A cos ?2t.
How does the modulation amplitude vary with time?
Solution
We define	?	?  1 (? + ? ),
av	2	1	2
?	?  1 (? - ? ), ? > ?
mod	2	1	2	1	2
where ?av is the average angular frequency and ?mod is the modulation angular frequency. Due to superposition of ?1 and ?2, we get
? = ?1 + ?2 = A[cos (?av+ ?mod)t + cos (?av - ?mod)t]
= Amod (t) cos ?avt	...(2.55)
where	Amod(t) = 2A cos ?mod t	(2.56)
     Equation (2.55) represents an oscillation at angular frequency ?av with an amplitude Amod that varies with time according to Eqn. (2.56). If ?1 ? ?2, ?mod << ?av. In this case the modulation amplitude Amod (t) varies only slightly during many fast oscillations of cos ?av t and therefore Eqn. (2.55) represents almost harmonic oscillation at angular frequency ?av with a slowly varying amplitude (Fig. 2.18).
     When the two waves are in phase, the resultant (? = ?1 + ?2) is maximum and Amod has its maximum value. When the two waves are out of phase the resultant is minimum and Amod has zero amplitude. There are two maximum amplitude positions for Amod (one positive
and one negative) in a 1 -modulation cycle. Number of beats per second is twice the modulation

frequency.

     Equation (2.56) gives the variation of the modulation amplitude Amod with time. By squaring this equation we get
A2	(t) = 2A2 (1 + cos 2?	t).

Thus A2	(t) oscillates about its average value at twice the modulation frequency i.e.
at the beat frequecy (?1 - ?2).
     15. Two tuning forks when sounded together give 4 beats per second. One is unison with a length of 96 cm of a sonometer wire under certain tension and the other with 96.8 cm of that wire under the same tension. Find the frequencies of these forks.
Solution
From the equation of transverse vibration of a sonometer wire (see Chapter 8), we have

n  =	1
1	2 ? 96
n  =	1
2	2 ? 96.8

T / ? ,
T / ?

where T is the tension of the wire and ? is the mass per unit length of the wire.

Thus,	n1
n2

=  96.8

and	n1 - n2 = 4
Solving we get n1 = 484 Hz and n2 = 480 Hz.
     16. Two identical simple pendulums a and b with the same string length l and the same bob mass m are coupled by a massless spring of spring constant k which is attached to the bobs. The spring is unstretched when both the strings of the pendulums are vertical.
(i) Derive the differential equations of motion (for small oscillations) of the bobs.
(ii) Find the normal mode frequencies, the configurations of the system in these modes and the normal coordinates.
(iii) Find a superposition of the two modes which correspond to the initial conditions (at time t = 0) that both the pendulums have /ero velocity, that bob a has amplitude
2A, and that bob b has /ero amplitude. Let Ea be the total energy of bob a at time t = 0. Find the expressions for the energy of bob a and that of bob b at any time.
(Assume weak coupling between the oscillators).
Solution
For solutions of (i) and (ii) see problem 13 of Chapter 2.
     (iii) Suppose X and Y are the normal coordinates satisfying the uncoupled differential equations

X?? Y??

= - ?2 X,	...(2.58)
= - ?2 Y	...(2.59)

with	X =  1 (x
2	1
Y =  1 (x
2	1

+ x2),

- x2)


where x1 and x2 are the displacements of the bobs a and b from their respective equilibrium positions.
The solutions of Eqns (2.58) and (2.59) are
X = A1 cos (?1t + ?1),
                                  Y = A2 cos (?2t + ?2) so that the displacements of the bobs are
x1 = A1 cos (?1t + ?1) + A2 cos (?2t + ?2),
x2 = A1 cos (?1t + ?1) - A2 cos (?2t + ?2).
The initial conditions give four equations
x1(0) = A1 cos ?1 + A2 cos ?2 = 2A,	...(2.60)
x2(0) = A1 cos ?1 - A2 cos ?2 = 0,	...(2.61)
x? 2(0) = - ?1 A1 sin ?1 - ?2 A2 sin ?2 = 0,	...(2.62)
x? 2(0) = - ?1 A1 sin ?1 + ?2 A2 sin ?2 = 0	(2.63)
From Eqns. (2.62) and (2.63), we find
sin ?1 = sin ?2 = 0.
     We make the choice of the phase constants ?1 and ?2 consistent with Eqns. (2.60) and (2.61). We take ?1 = ?2 = 0. We have from Eqns. (2.60) and (2.61) A1 = A2 = A so that the displacements of the bobs are given by
x1(t) = A cos ?1t + A cos ?2t.
x2(t) = A cos ?1t - A cos ?2t.
     The displacement of the bobs are obtained by the superposition of two normal modes of frequencies ?1 and ?2 which differ by a small amount when the coupling is weak i.e. k is small. We shall get the beat effect when the two modes X and Y are present with equal amplitudes A1 = A2 = A. The pendulum a is under the influence of two harmonic modes of equal amplitudes with slightly different frequencies. Thus the motion a exhibits beats. The pendulum b also exhibits beats.
     Initially the bob b is at zero and the bob a has displacement 2A. Both of them are released from rest at time t = 0. Gradually the oscillation amplitude of pendulum a decreases and that of pendulum b increases, until pendulum a comes to rest and pendulum b oscillates with the amplitude and energy that pendulum a started out with. (Here we neglect the frictional forces). The vibration energy is transferred completely from one pendulum to the other and the process continues. The vibration energy slowly flows back and forth between a and b. One complete round trip for the energy from a to b and back to a is a beat. The beat period is the time for the round trip.
We put	?1 = ?av - ?mod,
?2 = ?av + ?mod

and we get


where


x1 (t) = Amod (t) cos ?avt.
x2 (t) = Bmod (t) sin ?avt

Amod (t) = 2A cos ?modt,
Bmod (t) = 2A sin ?modt


Thus we get almost harmonic oscillations for x1 and x2. The beat frequency is


?	= ? - ? =

Thus x2 = 0 when x1 is maximum and x1 = 0 when x2 is maximum.
     Let us find an expression for the total energy (kinetic + potential) of each pendulum. For the pendulum a the oscillation amplitude Amod (t) is almost constant over one cycle of the fast oscillation. If the spring is weak it does not have significant amount of stored energy. Thus during one fast oscillation we think of pendulum a as a harmonic oscillator of frequency
?av with constant amplitude Amod.

Average KE of the pendulum a (averaged over one fast cycle) is  1 m??	A2

where E is the total energy of the system. The energy difference between the two pendulums is

Hence	E

     The energy Ea and Eb are plotted against t in Fig. 2.19. When the pendulum a has the maximum energy, the pendulum b has zero energy, and vice versa. The total energy of the
system E is constant and it flows back and forth between the two pendulums at the beat frequency.


     17. Two radio stations broadcast their programmes at the same amplitude A, and a slightly different frequencies ?1 and ?2 respectively, where ?2 - ?1 = 103 H/. A detector receives the signals from the two stations simultaneously. It can only detect signals of intensity ú 2A2.
(a) Find the time interval between successive maxima of the intensity of the signal received by the detector.
(b) Find the time for which the detector remains idle in each cycle of the intensity of the signal.	(I.I.T. 1993)

The resultant wave has the slowly varying amplitude
A? = 2A cos (?2- ?1) t/2.
It is maximum when (?2- ?1) t = 0, 2?, 4?,....
Hence the time interval between successive maxima is

?t =   2?	
?2 ? ?1

(b) For the intensity 2A2, the amplitude would be +	A.

Thus,2A cos (?2- ?1)t/2= +  2 Aorcos (?2- ?1)t/2= + 1	2

     During this time interval the detector remains idle for each cycle of the intensity of the signal.

From problem 2, we know that the resultant motion is given by
X = R sin (?t + ?)
with	R = a sin (N ? / 2)
sin (? / 2)
? = (N - 1) ?/2

Here, N = 3 and ? = 45°.


R = a sin 3?

where	? = 45°/2
Thus, R = a (1 ?  2)

The resultant motion is simple harmonic with amplitude (1 ?

     20. Two masses m1 and m2 connected by a light spring of natural length l is compressed completely and tied by a light thread. This system while moving with velocity v along the positive x-axis passes through the origin at time t = 0. At this position the thread snaps. Find the positions of two masses as functions of time for t m 0.
Solution
      Suppose x1 and x2 are the positions of two masses m1 and m2 at time t. The differential equations satisfied by x1 and x2 are
m1 ?x?1 = k (x2 - x1 - l) m2 ?x?2 = - k (x2 - x1 - l)
where k is the spring constant of the spring.
From these two equations, we get

?x?2 ? ?x?1

Thus,	x2 - x1 - l = A cos (?t + ?)

At t = 0, x2 = x1 = 0,

Again, at t = 0,

x?2 ? x?1 = 0.


0 = - A? sin ?.

Thus, ? = 0, A = - l.
and	x2 - x1 - l = - l cos ?t
or	x2 - x1 - l = l (1 - cos ?t)
We know that the centre of mass moves with velocity V.

Solving these two equations, we get

3.1 DAMPED HARMONIC MOTION
Various frictional forces may act on a harmonic oscillator, tending to reduce its successive amplitudes. Such a motion is called damped harmonic motion. Suppose a particle of mass m is subject to a restoring force proportional to the distance from a fixed point on the x-axis and a damping force proportional to the velocity. Then the equation of motion becomes

m?x? = - kx - ?x?

...(3.1)

x being the displacement of the particle from the fixed point at any instant t, k and ? are

positive constants. The damping force is -? x? (3.1) can be written as

where ? is the damping coefficient. Equation

?x?

Hence,	Li di dt

dq	1

L dt2  + R dt  + C q = 0	...(3.5)


or	?q?+ 2b q? + ?2q = 0	...(3.6)
which is the differential equation that describes the damped oscillations. This is equivalent to Eqn. (3.2).
The general solution of Eqn. (3.6) can be written as (see Eqn. (3.10)) [b < ?]
q = Q e-btcos (??t - ?).	(3.7)


     1. Obtain an expression for the displacement of the damped harmonic oscillator where the damping force is proportional to the velocity. Discuss the effect of the damping on the displacement and frequency of the oscillator.
Solution
The differential equation of the damped harmonic motion is given by Eqn. (3.2):

?x?

+ 2 x?

+ ?2x = 0 

where (-2mbx? ) = (?? x? ) is the damping force acting on the particle of mass m and ? is the natural frequency of the oscillator.
Let x = exp (?t) be the trial solution of above equation. Then, we have
?2 + 2b? + ?2 = 0.

The two roots of ? are




?1, 2 =



2	? ?b ?

So, the general solution of Eqn. (3.2) is
x = e-bt rjA

exp (?

where A1 and A2 are two constants whose values can be determined from the initial conditions.
Case I: b > ? (the damping force is large)
The expression (3.8) for x represents a damped dead beat motion, the displacement x
decreasing exponentially to zero (Fig. 3.1).
Case II: b < ? (the damping is small)

In this case

? i

? i?? and Eqn. (3.8) becomes

x = e-bt [B1cos ??t + B2 sin ??t]	...(3.9)
where ??=  ? 2 ? b2 , B1 = A1+ A2 and B2 = i (A1 - A2). If we write B1 = R cos ? and
B2 = R sin ?, Eqn. (3.9) reduces to


where  R =
            
x = Re-bt cos (??t - ?)	...(3.10) and	? = tan-1(B2/B1)

Fig. 3.1
     Equation (3.10) gives a damped oscillatory motion (Fig. 3.1). Its amplitude R exp (-bt) decreases exponentially with time. The time period of damped oscillation is

T =   2? ? 	2?	
??

...(3.11)

whereas the undamped time period is
T0


=   2? .
?

     Thus the time period of damped oscillation is slightly greater than the undamped natural time period when b ^ ?. In other words, the frequency of the damped oscillation

??=

is less than the undamped natural frequency ?.
Let us consider the simple case in which ? = 0 in Eqn. (3.10). Then cos ??t = + 1 when

t = 0, t = T , t = T, t = 3T etc. Suppose that the values of x in both directions corresponding
1	2	2	3	2
to these times are x0, x1, x2, x3 etc. so that
x0 = R
x1 = - Re-bT/2, x2 = Re-bT,
x3 = - Re-3bT/2,

Considering the absolute values of the displacements, we get
?	?	=... =	ebT/2





The quantity	? = 2 ln

= bT = b
?


...(3.12)

is called logarithmic decrement. Here ? is the frequency of the damped oscillatory motion. The logarithmic decrement is the logarithm of the ratio of two successive maxima in one
direction = ln (xn/xn+2). Thus the damping coefficient b can be found from an experimental measurement of consecutive amplitudes. Since



We have from Eqn. (3.12)

b = ? ?  , T = 	2?	 = 1 2m			?

and ?2 = k/m,

? = 	2??		(3.13)

The energy equation of the damped harmonic oscillator:
     We can regard equation (3.10) as a cosine function whose amplitude R exp (- bt) gradually decreases with time. For an undamped oscillator of amplitude R, the mechanical
energy is constant and is given by E = 1 kR2. If the oscillator is damped, the mechanical energy is not constant but decreases with time. For a damped oscillator the amplitude is R exp (- bt) and the mechanical energy is

where	E (0h) = 1
2
E (t) = 1
2

kR2 is the initial mechanical energy.

kR2 exp (-2bt)

Like the amplitude the mechanical energy decreases exponentially with time.
Case III: b = ? (critically damped motion)
When b = ?, we get only one root ? = - b. One solution of Eqn. (3.2) is
x1 = A1 exp (-bt)

and the other solution is


x2 = A2t exp (-bt).

So the general solution for critically damped motion (Fig. 3.1) is
x = e-bt(A1 + A2t)	...(3.14)
The motion is non-oscillatory and the particle approaches origin slowly.
     2. A particle of mass 3 moves along the x-axis attracted toward origin by a force whose magnitude is numerically equal to 12x. The particle is also subjected to a damping force whose magnitude is numerically equal to 12 times the instantaneous speed. If it is initially at rest at x = 10, find the position and the velocity of the particle at any time.
Solution
The equation of motion of the particle is
3?x?i? = - 12?x?i? - 12x?i?
or	?x?+ 4 ?x?+4x = 0.
The solution of this equation is
x = e-2t(A1 + A2t).


[See Eqn. (3.14)]. The motion is critically damped (b = ? = 2).

     When t = 0, x = 10 and at any time t is

x? = 0; therefore A1 = 10 and A2 = 20. The position of the particle

x = 10e-2t(1 + 2t).

The velocity is given by


v? =


x?i? = - 40t e-2t i? .

Initially

v? = 0 and the velocity becomes very small after a long time. The magnitude of

the velocity is maximum when t = 1 .
2
     3. A particle of mass 1 g moves along the x-axis under the influence of two forces: (i) a force of attraction toward origin which is numerically equal to 4x dynes, and (ii) a damping force whose magnitude in dynes is numerically equal to twice the instantaneous speed. Assuming that the particle starts from rest at a distance 10 cm from the origin, (a) set up the differential equation of motion of the particle, (b) find the position of the particle at any time, (c) determine the amplitude, period and frequency of the damped oscillation, and (d) find the logarithmic decrement of the problem.
Solution
(a) The differential equation for the motion of the particle is
?x?i? = - 4x i? - 2x? i?
or	?x? + 2 x? + 4x = 0.
This is an example where the motion is damped oscillation (b = 1, ? = 2 and b < ?).
(b) The solution of this equation is
x = R e-t cos ( 3 t ? ?)
[see Eqn. (3.10)]. Since x = 10 cm at t = 0, we find that R cos ? = 10.

Since

x? = 0 at t = 0, we have
- R cos ? +  3R sin ? = 0

Hence	? =  ??
6

and R = 20 cm.

Thus, we obtain	x =  20 e-t cos FGH

(c) Amplitude = 20 e-t cm. The amplitudes of oscillation decrease towards zero as t
increases.
Period =  2? s and frequency =	3 Hz.

(d) From Eqn. (3.12), the logarithmic decrement ? is given by
? = bT =  2? .


     4. A system of unit mass whose natural angular frequency in the absence of damping is 4 rad s-1 is subject to a damping force which is proportional to the velocity of the system, the constant of proportionality being 10 s-1. Show that the system is over damped and that the general solution for the displacement is
x = A exp (-2t) + B exp (- 8t).
     The mass is initially at x = 0.5 m and given an initial velocity v towards the equilibrium position. Find the smallest value of v that will produce negative displacement.
Solution
The equation of motion is
m?x? + ?x? + kx = 0
In the present problem, m = 1, ? = 10 and ? =	= 4 rad s-1. Thus 2b = ?/m = 10
and k = 16. Since b > ?, the damping force is large and the motion is over damped. The general solution for x is [see Eqn. (3.8)]
x = exp (-5t) [A exp (3t) + B exp (- 3t)]
= A exp (-2t) + B exp (- 8t).
Now at t = 0, x = 0.5 m and x? = - v, where v is a positive number. Thus, we have
   A + B = 0.5 -2A - 8B = -v
which give	x =   4 ? v exp (-2t) +  v ? 1 exp(-8t).

6
In order to make x negative it is necessary that  4 ? v
6

6

should be negative or, v > 4. Thus

v = 4 ms-1 is the minimum value of v required to give a negative displacement to the system.
     5. In a damped oscillatory motion an object oscillates with a frequency of 1 H/ and its amplitude of vibration is halved in 5 s. Find the differential equation for the oscillation. Find also the logarithmic decrement of the problem.
Solution
     The variation of x with t correspond to an underdamped decaying oscillation with differential equation
?x? + 2bx? + ?2x = 0

where b < ?. The solution of this equation is
x = R e-bt cos[



? 2 ? b2 t ? ?] .

It is given that	= 2?.1 = 2?

and	Re-5b

1
= R/2 or, b = 5 ln 2 = 0.139

Thus,	?2 = b2 + 4?2 = 39.50.
Hence, the required differential equation is
?x?+ 0.278 x? + 39.50x = 0.
The logarithmic decrement ? = b/v = 0.139.

At the end of the recoil, a damping dashpot is arranged in such a way that the launcher returns to the firing position without any oscillation (critical damping). The launcher recoils 3 m with an initial speed of 10 ms?1. Find (a) the recoil's spring constant and (b) the dashpot's coefficient of critical damping.
Solution
     (a) We use the principle of conservation of energy for the rocket launcher and the recoil spring:

     7. Solve the problem of simple pendulum if a damping force proportional to the instantaneous tangential velocity is taken into account.

     In cases (1) and (2) the pendulum bob gradually returns to the equilibrium position without oscillation. In case (3), the pendulum oscillates with frequency ?? and its amplitude decreases exponentially with time.
     8. (a) A steady force of 50 N is required to lift a mass of 2 kg vertically through water at a constant velocity of 2.5 m/s. Assuming that the effect of viscosity can be described by a force proportional to velocity, determine the constant of proportionality. (The effect of buoyancy is neglected.)
     (b) The same mass is then suspended in water by a spring with spring constant k = 120 Nm-1. Determine the equilibrium extension of the spring. The mass is further pulled through a small distance below its equilibrium position and released from rest at time t = 0. Show that it will vibrate about the equilibrium position according to an equation of the form
?x?+ 2bx? + ?2x = 0
and determine b and ? for this system. Show that the motion is under damped and find its period of oscillation. Find the time in which the amplitude of oscillation falls by a factor of e.
Solution
(a) When the mass is lifted vertically it moves with a constant velocity. Thus the net force acting on it is zero:
50 - mg - ?v = 0

or	? =   50 ? mg
v

= 50 ? 2 ? 9.8
2.5 

= 12.16 N sm-1 (? kg s-1)

where ? is the constant of proportionality.
     (b) When the mass is suspended by a spring of spring constant k, it will be stationary at equilibrium and no viscous force will act on it. If X is the extension of the spring, we have
mg = kX
or	X =  2 ? 9.8 = 0.163 m.
120
     When the mass is pulled through a small distance below its equilibrium position and then released, it will vibrate to and fro about the equilibrium position. Now a resistive force

of amount ?x?

will act on the body. Therefore the equation of motion is given by
m?x? = - ?x? - kx




or	?x?+ 2bx? + ?2x = 0
where	b =  ? ?

Since b < ?, the body will execute damped simple harmonic motion:



Its period of oscillation is

x = Re-bt cos[

T = 	2?	 = 0.88 s.

If t is the time in which the amplitude falls by a factor of e, then

     9. A point performs damped oscillations with frequency ? and amplitude a0 exp (-bt). Find the velocity amplitude of the point as a function of time t if at the initial moment t = 0 (i) its displacement is equal to a0, (ii) its displacement is /ero.
Solution
(i)	x = a0 e-bt cos ?t.
x? = - ba0e-bt cos ?t - a0?e-bt sin ?t
= Re-bt cos (?t - ?)
where	R cos? = - ba0 and R sin ? = - a0?.
Thus,	R = a0
and	the velocity amplitude = a0	? 2 ? b2 e?bt .
(ii)	x = a0e-bt sin ?t,
x? = -ba0e-bt sin ?t + a0?e-bt cos ?t
= Re-btcos (?t + ?),
where	R cos ? = a0? and R sin ? = ba0.
Thus	R = a0
and	the velocity amplitude = a0	? 2 ? b2 e?bt .
     10. A spring supports a mass of 5 g which performs damped oscillations. It is found to have successive maxima of 2.1 cm and 1.3 cm. If the damping coefficient ? is 10 g s-1, find the stiffness of the spring.

where	b =  ? ?

Thus,	?? =  2?b = 13.1016
?
and	?2 = ??2 + b2 = 172.652 = k/m
Hence,	k = m?2 = 0.005 × 172.652 = 0.863 N/m.
     11. An automobile suspension system is critically damped and its period of oscillation with no damping is one second. If the system is initially displaced by an amount x0, and released with /ero initial velocity, find the displacement at t = 2s.
Solution
The displacement for critically damped motion is given by
x = e-bt (A1 + A2t)
with	b = ? = 2?.

Now,

x? = - be-bt(A1 + A2t) + A2e-bt.

At t = 0, x0 = A1 and x? = 0 = - bA1 + A2.
which give A1 = x0 and A2 = 2?x0.
Thus,	x = x0 (1 + 2?t) e-2?t
At	t = 2s, x = 0.000047 x0.

Loss of energy of the mass in time dt is

form

Then the equation of motion becomes
m?x? = - kx- ?x? + F(t).	(4.1)
If the external force is periodic, F (t) = F sin pt, we can write Eqn. (4.1) in the following

?x?+ 2bx? + ?2x = f sin pt	(4.2)

where	b =  ? ?  , ?2 =  k , f = F .
	
2m	m	m
The general solution of Eqn. (4.2) is
x = x1 + x2	...(4.3)
where x1 is the general solution of the homogeneous equation (see problem 3-1):
                                   ?x?1 + 2bx?1 + ?2x1 = 0	...(4.4) and x2 is any particular integral of Eqn. (4.2). A particular solution of Eqn. (4.2) is given by (see problem 1)

where	tan ? =	2bp

     We have seen in problem 3-1 that x1 becomes negligible within a short time and so we call this solution the transient solution. After a long time when x1 becomes negligible the motion of the mass m is given by Eqn. (4.5) which is called the steady-state solution. In the steady state x2 has a frequency p which is equal to the frequency of the impressed force but lags behind by a phase angle ?. The vibrations or oscillations represented by x2 are called forced vibrations or forced oscillations.

where we have assumed b2 < 1 ?2. Near the frequency p of the impressed force given by
equation (4.8), very large oscillations may set in and the phenomenon is called amplitude resonance and the frequency is called the frequency of amplitude resonance or amplitude
resonant frequency. If the damping is very small, b2 << 1 ?2, the resonance frequency

However, the velocity amplitude of the system becomes maximum for p = ? for any given value of b (see problem 4-2). This phenomenon is known as velocity resonance or simply resonance.

4.4 HELMHOLTZ RESONATOR
Helmholtz resonator is used to determine the frequency of a vibrating body with the help of the phenomenon of resonance. The resonator consists of either a spherical or a cylindrical air cavity with a small neck (Fig. 4.1). The dimension of the cavity is small in comparison with the wavelength of sound to be detected. In case of



Fig. 4.1

spherical cavity the volume of the cavity is fixed whereas the volume is variable in case of cylindrical cavity.


     The air contained at the neck of the resonator acts like a piston alternately compressing and rarefying the air within the cavity of the resonator. The natural frequency of vibration of Helmholtz resonator is given by


? =
where	v	= Velocity of propagation of sound in air
l	= Length of the neck of the resonator
S	= Area of cross-section of the neck
V	= Volume of the resonator.

...(4.12)

     The natural frequency of the resonator can be changed by changing the volume V of the resonator. When the sound wave of frequency resonant with the natural frequency of the resonator is incident on it, the resonator will produce sharp response. The frequency of the vibrating body is then equal to the natural frequency of the resonator given by Eqn. (4.12).

?x?1 + 2bx?1 + ?2x1 = 0
and x2 is any particular integral of Eqn. (4.2). The solution x1 is the displacement of the damped harmonic oscillator.
x  = e-bt rjA exp( b2 ? ?2 t) ? A exp (? b2 ? ? 2 t)yj
1	L 1	2	Q
x1 is the same as the damped oscillation (b < ?) or dead beat motion (b > ?) or critically damped motion (b = ?).
To find x2 let us take the solution
x2 = A sin (pt - ?).	(4.13)


     This supposition is justifiable on the ground that the system will ultimately vibrate with the same frequency p as that of the impressed sustained harmonic force.

Now,

x?2 = A p cos (pt - ?)
?x?2 = - Ap2 sin (pt - ?).

Substituting in Eqn. (4.2), we get
A(?2 - p2) sin(pt - ?) + 2Abp cos (pt - ?) = f sin {(pt - ?) +?}
= f sin (pt - ?) cos ? + f cos (pt - ?) sin ?	(4.14)
       Since Eqn. (4.14) is true for all values of t we can equate the coefficients of sin (pt - ?) and cos (pt - ?) from both sides:
A(?2 - p2) = f cos ?	(4.15)
2Abp = f sin ?	(4.16)

Hence, we get


A =	f



...(4.17)



and	tan ? =	2bp
?2 ? p2


...(4.18)

Eqns. (4.15) and (4.16) give
sin ? =	2bp

cos ? =	? 2 ? p2



...(4.19)


...(4.20)


Since sin ? is never negative, the range of ? is 0 ? ? ? ?. The complete solution of Eqn. (4.2) is

f
x = x1 +

sin (pt - ?).	(4.21)


     When b < ? the first part x1 represents natural vibrations of damped harmonic oscil- lator. These vibrations become negligible very soon as the amplitude diminishes exponentially with time. If the damping is very small the natural vibrations will persist for a longer time. After a long time when x1 becomes negligible we can write

x =	f

sin (pt - ?).	(4.22)


which is called the steady-state solution. Eqn. (4.22) represents the sustained forced vibrations.
If the frequency of vibrations of x1, that is, ?2 ? b2 and that of x2 i.e. p are nearly equal, at the initial stage, beats are produced. These beats are transient, as the natural vibrations become small after a short interval of time.


     2. Obtain the expression for the velocity of the mass m when it is in the steady state forced vibration of problem 1. Show that the velocity amplitude is maximum when the reso- nant frequency is p = ? and the velocity amplitude at resonance is




Solution


var

For the steady-state forced vibration the displacement x of the particle is given by
                               x = A sin (pt - ?) The velocity of the particle at any instant is
x? = Ap cos (pt - ?) = va cos (pt - ?)
where the velocity amplitude va is given by
v  = Ap =	fp

=	f	.



     When p = ?, va is maximum for any given value of b. This phenomenon is known as velocity resonance. The velocity amplitude at resonance is


var

=  f .

3. In the steady state forced vibration of problem 1 show that (a) the amplitude of the
driven system is maximum when p =	and
(b) the value of the maximum amplitude is	f	.

Solution
     (a) In the steady state forced vibration the amplitude of vibration of the driven system is given by
A =	f	.

It is maximum when the denominator (or the square of the denominator) is a minimum. Let	u = (?2 - p2)2 + 4b2p2.
The function u has a minimum or maximum when
du
dp  = -2(?2 - p2) 2p + 8b2p = 0
or	p(p2 - ?2 + 2b2) = 0
i.e.	p = 0 or, p =	where ?2 > 2b2.



For	p = 0, d2u  = -4 (?2 - 3p2 - 2b2) = -4(?2 - 2b2) < 0.
dp2

For	p =

, d2u 


?2 - 2b2 - 3(?2 - 2b2)]




Thus p =

dp2 = - 4[
= 8 (?2 - 2b2) > 0.
gives the minimum of u.

     Note that the angular frequency p of the periodic impressed force at amplitude reso- nance is slightly smaller than that at velocity resonance.
(b) The maximum amplitude at resonance is
f	f
Amax  =	=

     4. In the steady state forced vibration describe how the phase of the driven system changes with the frequency of the driving system.
Solution
     The phase angle ? is given by Eqns. (4.18-4.20). Suppose that the angular frequency of the impressed force is increased gradually from 0 to ?.
(i) When p = 0, ? = 0. There is no difference of phase between the driven system and the impressed force.
(ii) When p < ?, tan ? = +ve, cos ? = +ve and sin ? = +ve. Thus ? has a value intermediate between 0 and ?? .
2
(iii) When p ? ?, tan ? ? ?, sin ? ? 1 and cos? ? 0. So, ? ? ?? . Thus at velocity
2
resonance the driven system lags behind the driver by an angle ?? .
2

(iv) When p > ?, tan ? = -ve, sin ? = +ve and cos ? = -ve. Here, ??
2

< ? < ?.

(v) When p ? ?, tan ? ? 0, sin ? ? 0 and cos ? ? -1. Hence ? ? ?. The variation of ? with p is shown in Fig. 4.2.
We know that

? = tan?1

2bp	.	?
?2 ? p2

Thus the rate of change of ? with p is

 d? dp

=	2b( p2 ? ?2)	.
(?2 ? p2)2 ? 4b2 p2

?	? ? 
2

At resonance (p = ?),  d? = 1 .

dp	b	?

     Hence smaller the value of b, the greater is the rate of change of phase angle near the resonance frequency.

     5. Show that in the steady state forced vibration the rate of dissipation of energy due to frictional force is equal to the rate of supply of energy by the driving force in each cycle.
Solution
In the steady state forced vibration the displacement of the particle is given by
x = A sin (pt - ?).
     Suppose at any instant the force F sin pt moves through a distance dx in time dt. Then the work done by the force = F sin pt dx. The rate of work done averaged over a cycle is

1  Tz	F dx I

where we have put T =  2? .
p

=  1 FpA sin ?	...(4.23)
2

     Work done against the frictional force ?x? for the displacement dx is ?x? dx. Rate of work done against the frictional force averaged over a cycle is

dt =

Now we have to show that the expression (4.23) is equal to expression (4.24).
Now,	sin ? = 2bp A = ? p A
	 
f	m	f
and	F = fm
Thus 1 FpA sin ? = 1 fmp A ?pA  = 1 ?A2p2.
2 2	mf	2
     Since energy is dissipated in each cycle due to frictional force, this loss is made up by the energy supplied by the driving force to maintain the steady forced vibration.
     In the steady state forced vibration the displacement of the particle is sinusoidal and the mechanical energy remains fixed at the steady value 1 kA2.
6. (a) Show that in the steady state forced vibration the power supplied by the driving force averaged over a cycle is given by
P =	mb p2 f 2
(? 2 ? p2 )2 ? 4b2 p2
and the power is maximum when p = ?


(b) Find the two values of p, namely p1 and p2 at which the power P is half of that at resonance and show that p1 . p2 = ?2.
(c) Show that the full width of the power resonance curve at half maximum = 2b. If sharpness of resonance s is defined by

Sharpness of resonance =	Frequency at resonance

7. If the quality factor Q in the steady state forced vibration is defined as
Q =  2? ? Average energy stored per cycle Average energy dissipated per cycle

then show that

Q = 4b GH1 ? p2 JK .
Show that the quality factor is minimum at resonance p = ? and its minimum value is



Solution

Total energy at any instant of time in the steady state is

The average value of cos2 (pt - ?) and sin2 (pt - ?

Thus,	Eav

=  1 mA2 (p2 + ?2).

From problem 5 we know that the average power dissipated = 1 ?A2p2.

Average power dissipated per cycle = T × 1 ?A2p2,

Q is minimum when dp  = 0 or, p = ? and dp2 |p ? ? ? 2b? ? 0.
Thus the minimum of Q occurs at resonance when p = ? and the minimum value is ??  .

    9. A machine of total mass 90 kg is supported by a spring resting on the floor and its motion is constrained to be in the vertical direction only. The system is lightly damped with a damping constant 900 Ns/m. The machine contains an eccentrically mounted shaft which, when rotating at an angular frequency p, produces a vertical force on the system of Fp2 sin pt where F is a constant. It is found that resonance occurs at 1200 r.p.m. (revolutions per minute) and the amplitude of vibration in the steady state is then 1 cm. Find the amplitude of vibration in the steady state when the driving frequency is (a) 2400 r.p.m. (b) 3000 r.p.m.
(c) very large. Find also the quality factor Q at resonance. Assume that the gravity has a negligible effect on the motion.

     10. Two bodies of masses m1 and m2 connected by a spring of spring constant k, can move along a hori/ontal line (axis of the spring). A periodic force F cos ?t is exerted on the body of mass m1 along the line. Find expression for the displacements of the two masses and indicate by a sketch graph the dependence of the amplitude of motion of m1 on frequency ?.
Solution
     Let x1 and x2 be the respective displacements of the masses m1 and m2 from their equilibrium positions. The extension of the spring is x2 - x1. Thus the Eqns. of motion of m1 and m2 are

m1 ?x?1
m2 ?x?2

= k (x2 - x1) + F exp (i?t)	...(4.25)
= - k (x2 - x1).	(4.26)

[We use complex exponential motion to simplify the calculation]
Since we are forcing the bodies at frequency ?, let us try solutions
x1 = A exp (i?t)	...(4.27)
x2 = B exp (i?t)	...(4.28)
Substituting Eqns. (4.27) and (4.28) into Eqns. (4.25) and (4.26), we get
kB - kA + F = -m1A?2
-kB + kA = -m2B?2

which give


B =	kA
k ? m2?2



...(4.29)

and	A =	F(k ? m2? 2)
?2[m1m2? 2 ? k(m1 ? m2)]


...(4.30)


Thus,	x1

and	x2

=	F(k ? m2? 2) cos?t
?2[m1m2? 2 ? k(m1 ? m2)]
= 	Fk cos?t	
?2[m1m2? 2 ? k(m1 ? m2)]


...(4.31)

...(4.32)


The amplitude of the motion of m1 is A	A
[Eqn. (4.30)]. It is zero when ?2 = k/m2 and
infinite (resonance) when ?2 = k(m1 ? m2 ) . The
m1m2

amplitude tends to zero as ? tends to infinity.
The amplitude will also be infinite when ? = 0	O	w
(this corresponds to a steady force accelerat- ing the whole system).
Fig. 4.4 shows a sketch of A as a function

of ?.

11. A periodic external force acts on a 3 kg mass suspended from the lower end of a

vertical spring having spring constant 75 N/m. The damping force is proportional to the instantaneous speed of the mass and is 20 N when the speed is 1 m/s. Find the frequency at which amplitude resonance occurs.
Solution
Natural angular frequency of the spring = ? =	= 5 rad s-1.

Damping force = ?x?

12. The mass on a vertical spring undergoes forced vibrations according to the Eqn.
?x?+ ?2x = f sin ?t.
where there is no damping and the impressed frequency is equal to the natural frequency of oscillation. (a) Obtain the solution of the above differential equation (b) Give a physical interpretation.
Solution
(a) The general solution of the equation
?x? + ?2x = f sin ?t	...(4.33)
is	x = x1+ x2	...(4.34)
where x1 is the general solution of the homogeneous equation
?x?1 + ?2x1 = 0	...(4.35)
and x2 is the particular integral of Eqn. (4.33). Now the general solution of Eqn. (4.35) is
x1 = A cos ?t + B sin ?t	(4.36)
The particular solution of Eqn. (4.33) has the form
x = t[c1 cos ?t + c2 sin ?t]




which gives


x?
?x?


= (c1 cos ?t + c2 sin ?t) + t(-?c1 sin ?t + ?c2 cos ?t)
= 2(-?c1 sin ?t + ?c2 cos ?t) - t?2(c1 cos ?t + c2 sin ?t).

Substituting these into Eqn. (4.33) and simplifying, we obtain
2c2? cos ?t - 2c1? sin ?t = f sin ?t


from which c2


= 0 and c1

= - f
2?

. Thus the particular integral is

x  = - ft
2	2?

     The general solution of Eqn. (4.33) is therefore

x = A cos ?t + B sin ?t - ft

cos ?t

(b) The first two terms of Eqn. (4.38)	O
are oscillatory with constant amplitude. The
last term involving t increases with time to such an extent that the spring breaks fi- nally. A graph of the last term is shown in Fig. 4.5. This example illustrates the phe- nomenon of resonance. Here the natural frequency of the spring equals the frequency of the impressed force.

     13. A vertical spring has a spring constant 50 N/m. At t = 0 a force given in newtons by F (t) = 48 cos 7t, t ? 0 is applied to a 20 N weight which hangs in equilibrium at the end of the spring. Neglecting damping find the position of the weight at any later time t.
Solution
We have the equation of motion
20 ?x? = - 50x + 48 cos 7t
g

or	?x?
where we put g = 10 m/s2.

+ 25x = 24 cos 7t	...(4.39)

The complementary function of Eqn. (4.39) is
                                    x = A cos 5t + B sin 5t	...(4.40) and the particular integral is given by
                               x = c1 cos 7t + c2 sin 7t	...(4.41)
     Substituting Eqn. (4.41) into Eqn. (4.39), we get c1 = - 1 and c2 = 0. Thus the general solution is
x = A cos 5t + B sin 5t - cos 7t	...(4.42)



x








O	t







     Using the initial conditions we find, A = 1, B = 0 and thus




x  = 0,

Fig. 4.6

x? = 0 at t = 0

x = cos 5t - cos 7t = 2 sin t sin 6t.	(4.43)

     The graph of x vs. t is shown by the heavy curve of Fig. 4.6. The dashed curves are the curves of x = + 2 sin t. If we consider that 2 sin t is the amplitude of sin 6t, we see that the amplitude varies sinusoidally. The phenomenon is known as amplitude modulation (see problem 14 chapter 2).
14. Show that the natural frequency of vibration of Helmholt/ resonator is given by

? =

where	v = Velocity of propagation of sound in air l = Length of the neck of the resonator
V = Volume of the resonator
S = Area of cross-section of the neck.
Solution
     We assume that the air in the neck of Helmholtz resonator acts as a piston alternately compressing and rarefying the air within the cavity of the resonator.
Let x = Displacement towards the cavity of the piston of sectional area S at any instant
t and ?P be the increase in the pressure in the cavity.
Total force acting on the piston is

Sl? d2 x

where ? = Density of air and Sl? = Mass of air in the neck.
Since the pressure change in the cavity is adiabatic
PV? = Constant
or	?PV? + P?V?-1?V = 0



or	?P = -?P ??V

     We consider a steady-state solution of Eqn. (4.44) in the form (after the alternating emf has been applied for some time)

5.1 WAVES
A wave is a disturbance that moves through a medium without giving the medium, as a whole, any permanent displacement. The general name for these waves is progressive wave. If the disturbance takes place perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave, the wave is called transverse. If the disturbance is along the direction of propagation of the wave, it is called longitudinal. At any point, the disturbance is a function of time and at any instant, the disturbance is a function of the position of the point. In a sound wave, the disturbance is pressure-variation in a medium. In the transmission of light in a medium or vacuum, the disturbance is the variation of the strengths of the electric and magnetic fields. In a progres- sive wave motion, it is the disturbance that moves and not the particles of the medium.

5.2 WAVES IN ONE DIMENSION
Suppose a wave moves along the x-axis with constant velocity v and without any change of shape (i.e. with no dispersion) and the disturbance takes place parallel to the y-axis, then
y (x, t) = f (x - vt)	...(5.1)
defines a one-dimensional wave along the positive direction of the x-axis (forward wave). A wave which is the same in all respect but moving in the opposite direction (i.e. along the direction of x decreasing) is given by Eqn. (5.1) with the sign of v changed:
y (x, t) = f (x + vt)	...(5.2)
This is known as backward wave. Eqns. (5.1) and (5.2) satisfy the second-order partial differential equation:

?2 y
?x2  =

1  ?2 y


v2 ?t2


...(5.3)

Eqn. (5.3) is known as the non-dispersive wave equation.
     A wave whose profile is that of a sine or cosine function is called a harmonic wave. We can express such a wave as
y = f (x - vt) = A sin k (x - vt)	...(5.4)
where A is the amplitude of the wave and k is called the circular wave number. For a particular point x = x1, we may write Eqn. (5.4) as
y = - A sin k (vt - x1)	...(5.5a)


= A cos k jjvt ? x1 ? ?? 7j	(5.5b)
H	2kj
     Sine and cosine functions have exactly the same form, the only difference between them being the point at which the origin is chosen. Since the choice of origin is always completely arbitrary, the first minus sign in Eqn. (5.5a) can be removed by a new choice of origin.
We know that a point executing simple harmonic motion has the equation of motion
y = A sin (?t - ?)	...(5.6)
Comparing Eqns. (5.5a) and (5.6), we have

? = kv or, k = ??
v

=  2?? ,	...(5.7)
v

where ? is the frequency of oscillations caused by the wave. Since T = 1/?, we can identify the period of the wave as
T =   2?	(5.8)
kv
Since the sine function is periodic, the wave profile repeats itself after fixed interval of
x. The repeat distance is known as the wavelength and is designated by ?. Since
y = A sin k (x - vt) = A sin k [(x + ?) -vt)]

we have


k? = 2? or, k =  2?
?


=  2??
v



...(5.9)

and	v = ?? = ?	(5.10)
k
v is called the 'phase velocity' of the travelling wave.
We can write Eqn. (5.4) in a number of equivalent forms:
y = A sin (kx - ?t)	(5.11)
y = A sin  2? (x - vt)	(5.12)
?
y = A sin 2? jj x ?  t 7j	(5.13)
H ?	T j
By a different choice of the origin, we could equally well arrive at the expression
y = A sin (?t - kx)	...(5.14)
Again,	y = A exp [i (?t - kx)]	...(5.15)
is the exponential representation of a harmonic wave. When a sine wave is expressed in the form of Eqn. (5.15), it is the imaginary part of the expression that has physical meaning.
If we compare two similar waves

y  = A sin  2? (x - vt),
1	?
y = A sin rj 2? (x ? vt) ? ?yj = A sin  2?



rjjjx ? ??  ?7j ? vtyj

2	L ?

Q	? LH

2?  j	Q





we see that y2


is the same as y1

except that it is displaced by a distance d = ??  ;	is called
2?

the phase of y2 relative to y1 and d the path difference:
Path difference =  ??  × phase difference.	(5.16)
2?
If ? = 2?, 4?,..., then d = ?, 2?,..., and we say that the waves are in phase, and y1 = y2. If
? = ?, 3?,..., then the two waves are exactly out of phase and y1 = - y2.

5.3 THREE DIMENSIONAL WAVE EQUATION

5.5 STROBOSCOPE OR STROBE
It is an instrument used to make a rotating, oscillating or vibrating body appear to be stationary or slow-moving. In a simple instrument a rotating disc with evenly spaced holes is placed in the line of sight between the observer and the cyclically moving body. The frequency of the rotational disc is adjusted so that it becomes perfectly synchronised with the cyclically moving object which appear to be completely stationary to the observer. This illusion caused by the synchronised motion of two bodies is known as stroboscopic effect. This method is used to find the frequency of the periodically moving object. Very short flashes of light are used to produce still photographs of first moving objects. In medicine stroboscopes are used to view the motion of vocal chords.
     Determination of the frequency of a tuning fork by stroboscopic method: Two thin light aluminium plates are attached to the inner sides of the prongs of the tuning fork. When the prongs during vibrations are wide apart, a rectangular slit is formed once per vibration of the prongs at the time of maximum displacement of the prongs away from each other. A circular disc with equispaced radial stripes is rotated and viewed through the slit when the fork is vibrating. The angular velocity of the disc is gradually increased. At a certain minimum speed of the disc the stripes appear stationary. This will occur when one


stripe exactly succeeds the preceding one in the time between two successive openings of the slit. If N = number of stripes in the disc, p = number of revolutions of the disc per second, then the frequency of the tuning fork is given by
n = p N.
     The disc can be run by a motor at any desired speed. If the speed of the disc is increased gradually the pattern appears stationary to produce the stroboscopic effect at the angular velocity of the disc which is the multiple of the minimum required speed.

     Find (a) the amplitude of the wave, (b) the magnitude of the propagation vector, (c) the wavelength, (d) the time period, and (e) the wave velocity.
Solution
     The various parameters of the given harmonic wave can be found by comparing it with the standard form
                                   y = A sin (kx - ?t) for a wave propagating in the positive x-direction.
(a) The amplitude A = 0.1 m
(b) The propagation vector k = 0.1 m-1
(c) The wavelength ? = 2?/k = 20? m
(d) The angular frequency ? = 0.1 s-1, time period T = 2?/? = 20? s
(e) The wave velocity v = ?/k = 1 m/s.
2. Show that
y(x, t) = f(x - vt)
represents a one-dimensional travelling wave (or progressive wave) moving with constant velocity v and without any change of shape along the positive direction of x.
Solution
     Consider a disturbance y which propagates along the x-axis with velocity v (Fig. 5.1). The disturbance y may refer to the elevation of water wave or the magnitude of the y-displacement of a string. Since the disturbance is moving, y will depend on x and t. When t = 0, y will be some function of x which we may call f (x). We assume that the wave propagates without change of shape. At a later time t, the wave profile will be identical with that at t = 0, except that the wave profile has moved a distance (vt) in the positive x-direction. If we take a new origin O? at the point x = vt, and denote distances measured from O? by X, then x = X + vt, and the equation of the wave profile, referred to this new origin, is



y









O	x
vt

Fig. 5.1
y = f (X),
or	y (x,t) = f (x - vt).
This equation is the most general expression of a wave moving with constant velocity
v without change of shape along the positive direction of x.
3. Show that the most general solution of one dimensional wave equation

Integrating we get

y = zF(u)du ? g(w)

= f (u) + g (w)
Thus, the general solution of the wave equation is
y = f (x - vt) + g (x + vt).
     The waves ? (x - vt) and g (x + vt) travel with same velocity v, but in opposite directions. The wave ? (x - vt) is called forward wave which moves along the positive x-direction and the wave g (x + vt) is backward wave which moves in the negative x-direction. The method described here for solving the partial differential equation is known as D' Alembert's method.

(i) Let s? be a unit vector in a fixed direction. We consider a plane perpendicular to this
fixed direction so that the distance of this plane from the origin is ON = Constant (Fig. 5.2).
Let r? (x, y, /) be the position vector of a point P on this plane. Then,
r? ? s? = ON = Constant.
Thus, the equation of the plane perpendicular to the unit vector s? is
s? ? r? = Constant

Fig. 5.2


     (ii) A plane wave is one in which the disturbance is constant for all points of a plane drawn perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Such a plane is called a plane wave front, and the wave front moves perpendicular to itself with the velocity of propagation v. Let
s? (sx, sy, s/) be a unit vector in the direction of propagation of the wave. A solution of the wave equation of the form
? = ? (r? ? s?, t)
is said to represent a plane wave, since at each instant of time, ? is a constant over each of

the planes

r? ? s? = constant, which is perpendicular to the unit vector s? .

     It will be convenient to choose a new set of Cartesian axes O?, O? and O? with O? in the direction of s. Then,
r? ? s? = ?
or	xsx + ysy + /s/ = ?.

     9. A sinusoidal wave travelling in the positive x-direction on a stretched string has amplitude 2.0 cm, wavelength 1.0 m and velocity 5.0 ms-1. The initial conditions are: y = 0
and ??y < 0 at x = 0 and t = 0. Find the wave function y = f (x, t).

Solution
The general form of a wave travelling in the positive x direction is
y(x, t) = A cos rj2?Jj x ?  t 7j ? ?yj .
L H ?	T J	Q
Here, A = 0.02 m,	= 1.0 m and v = ?? = 5 ms-1. So, T = 0.2 s. Thus,
T
y = 0.02 cos [2? (x - 5t) +?].
Putting t = 0, x = 0 and y = 0, we obtain 0.02 cos ? = 0 or, cos ? = 0.

Now, ??y
?t

= 0.02 ×10? sin [2? (x - 5t) +?].

It is given that ??y < 0 at x = 0, t = 0, i.e. sin ? < 0. Hence we may conclude that

Solution
     We consider a very small segment of the continuous string. At equilibrium the segment occupies a small length ?x centered at x (Fig. 5.3). Let the mass of this segment be ?m. Now
mass density ? = ??m . The mass density is assumed to be uniform along the string. The

     For a general non-equilibrium situation the segment has a transverse displacement y (x, t) averaged over the segment AB. The segment AB is no longer exactly straight. It has (generally) a slight curvature. We draw tangents at the points A and B to the displaced segment AB. Tensions T1 and T2 to the segment AB act along the tangents. The tension in the segment is no longer T, since the segment is longer than its equilibrium length ?x. The tangents at the points A and B make angles ?1 and ?2 with the horizontal line. Let us find
the net upward force Fy on the segment. At its left end the segment is pulled downward with a force T1 sin ?1. At its right end it is pulled upward with a force T2 sin ?2. Thus, the net upward force on the segment ?x of the string is
Fy(t) = T2 sin ?2 ? T1 sin ?1
     In the small oscillation approximation, we may neglect the increase in length of the segment, and the angles ?1 and ?2 are very small. So, sin ?2 ? tan ?2 and sin ?1 ? tan ?1, T2 ? T and T1 ? T. We now have
Fy(t) = T tan ?2 -T tan ?1.

     11. (a) An elastic string fixed at the top end has mass 1 g and natural length 0.1 m. A mass 1.1 kg is attached to its lower end, and the spring is stretched by 0.022 m. Calculate the speed of propagation of transverse waves along the string. If the mass makes small vertical oscillations, find its time period of oscillation.
     (b) A transverse disturbance travels down the string starting from the upper end and is reflected at lower end. The reflected wave travels up the string and is reflected again from the upper point. If this process continues, how many times will this disturbance pass the middle point of the string in one period of a small vertical oscillation of the mass?
[Take the tension in the string to be uniform]	O
Solution


(a) vtr

=

= 32.83 m/s.

Time period of vertical oscillation of the mass is

2?	= 0.298 s.


(b) Distance traversed by the transverse wave in time 0.298 s is
32.83 × 0.298 = 9.78 m. The transverse wave passes the middle point first time when it traverses a distance = 0.1/2 = 0.05 m. In traversing the remaining distance (9.78 - 0.05 = 9.78 m), it passes the middle point 9.73/0.1 = 97.3 times. Thus, the total number of times = 1 + 97
= 98.
     12. A wire of mass m and length l is fixed at the top end, and hangs freely under its own weight. Deduce the time for a transverse wave to travel the length of the wire.

Solution
Mass per unit length of the wire = ? = m .

     Consider a small portion of the string of length dx at a distance x from the point of suspension O (Fig. 5.4). The tension at this point is (l - x) ?g and the velocity of propagation of transverse wave at this point is

     13. A uniform inextensible string of length l and total mass M is fixed at one end and hangs freely under its own weight. It is tapped at the top end so that a transverse wave runs down it. At the same moment a small stone is released from rest and falls freely from the top of the string.
How far from the top does the stone pass the wave?
Solution
From the previous problem we find that the time taken by the wave to travel from
x = 0 to x = x is


T(x) =

x 	dx	
0

?  2

The time t(x) for the stone to fall from rest through a distance x is

t(x) =	.

Equating t(x) and T(x) to find the value of x at which the wave and the stone meet, we
get
= 2[	?  l ? x ].
     Solving this equation we obtain x = 0 or 8l/9. Now, x = 0 corresponds to the situation when the wave and the stone just start moving. The two again meet at a distance 8l/9 from the top of the string.
     14. Show that the velocity of propagation of longitudinal waves in a fluid (liquid or gas) contained in an infinitely long tube is given by
v =


where	K = Bulk modulus of the fluid,
?0 = Equilibrium density of the fluid.
Solution
     We consider an infinitely long tube of cross-section A (Fig. 5.5), containing a fluid (liquid or gas). Suppose that originally the fluid is at rest, its density is ?0 and pressure P0. Let R be a section of the medium of area A, perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave. Let S be a parallel section of equal area ?x apart, ?x being an elementary thickness of the layer. The coordinates of R and S are x and x + ?x respectively. Originally the small cylinder of fluid RS experiences an equal pressure P0 exerted at both ends by the surround- ing fluid. Suppose the fluid is set into longitudinal agitation, for example by inserting a piston in the tube somewhere to the left of R and causing it to oscillate longitudinally. This

will set the adjacent fluid into longitudinal oscillation, and this disturbance will propagate along the fluid in the form of a longitudinal wave. Suppose that at a given instant, the
cylinder RS is displaced to a new position R?S? such that R?R = ? and S?S = ? + ??? ?x. The
?x
variable ? measures the longitudinal displacement of a point due to the passage of the wave.
The thickness of the layer R?S? is ?x + ??? ?x. Thus, the increase of thickness of the layer due
?x
to the longitudinal oscillation at that instant = ??? ?x. Since there is no motion perpendicular
?x
to the direction of propagation of the wave, the corresponding increase in volume = A ??? ?x.
?x
     We shall find the equation of motion of the fluid at R?S?. For this purpose we require to know its mass and the pressure at its two ends. Its mass is same as the mass of the undisturbed element RS, that is A?0?x, where ?0 = normal average density or equilibrium density of the fluid. Let the pressure on the left-hand face R´ be P and that on the right-hand face S´ be P + ?P. The bulk modulus K of a material is a measure of the pressure increase to change its volume by a given amount. It is defined as

     Note: Newton assumed isothermal gas law for the propagation of sound wave through the gaseous medium and arrived at this result. This is off the actual value by 15%. Later on, Laplace corrected Newton's result by using adiabatic gas law instead of Boyle's law. The process takes place so rapidly that there is no flow of heat. There is not sufficient time for heat to flow from the compressions to rarefactions. (see problem 18).

? = Density of the material of the rod.
Solution
     We consider a section R of the rod of cross-sectional area A. Let S be a parallel section of equal area ?x apart (see Fig. 5.5). The variable ? measures the longitudinal displacement of a point due to passage of the wave. The increase in thickness of the layer = (??/?x)?x. Relating change in length to force (F) acting, we have, from the definition of Young's modulus (E),

6.2 STATIONARY WAVES
When two waves of same amplitude and frequency travel in a medium in opposite directions with the same velocity, due to superposition of two waves there are some points of the medium which have no displacements (nodes) and there are some points which vibrate with maximum amplitudes (antinodes). The resultant wave is called a stationary wave or standing wave. The resultant wave remains confined in the region in which they are produced and is non-progressive in character.

6.3 WAVE REFLECTION
Standing waves on a string are produced by reflection of travelling waves from the ends of the string. If an end is fixed, it must be the position of a node; if it is free, it is the position of an antinode. These boundary conditions limit the frequencies of waves for which standing wave will occur on a given string. Each possible frequency is a resonant frequency. For a stretched string of length l with fixed ends the resonant frequencies are

? =  v
?

=  v n, n = 1, 2, 3,...
2l

     We can obtain standing sound waves in a fixed length of a pipe. The closed end of the pipe, like the fixed end of a string, is a displacement node. At the open end of a pipe, however, we find a displacement antinode. The allowed frequencies of an open pipe are



where l = Length of the pipe.

=  v  =  v
?	2l


n, n = 1, 2, 3, ...


For a pipe closed at one end the allowed frequencies are
v	v
= ?  = 4l n, n = 1, 3, 5,...
     The lowest frequency that may be excited, corresponding to n = 1 is called the fundamental or the first harmonic, the remaining frequencies being called the second (n = 2), third (n = 3) harmonics, and so on. Note that in a closed pipe only odd harmonics are excited.
     The air particles at the end of a pipe have freedom of movement and hence the vibration of air particles at the open end of the pipe is extended a little more into the air outside the pipe. The antinode at the open end of the pipe is thus situated at a distance, say, x into the air outside. This distance is known as end-correction.

     When two waves are superposed to form a wave group the energy is carried forward with the group velocity.
     When ?/k or vp depends on the wavelength (hence on the frequency), the waves are called dispersive. If vp increases with wavelength in some wavelength range, the medium is said to possess normal dispersion in this range (Fig. 6.3). If vp decreases with wavelength in some wavelength range, it is said to possess anomalous dispersion in this range (Fig. 6.4).

     For the standing wave, the parts of the body oscillate in harmonic motion at the same angular frequency ? and with the same phase constant ?. Thus y (x, t) should have the same time dependence, sin (?t + ?), for all particles i.e., for all x. In this case, the amplitude of vibration at x can be written as a continuous function of x denoted by A (x). We can write the general expression for standing wave as
y(x, t) = A (x) sin (?t + ?).
Substituting this into the wave equation, we get
- ?2 A (x) = v2 d2 A(x) ·
dx2
The general solution of this equation is


A (x) = A sin

FGH? IJK x + B cos

F? I H v K

= A sin kx + B cos kx.
Thus, the general solution for the displacement in the standing wave is
y(x, t) = (A sin kx + B cos kx) sin (?t + ?).
     For the standing waves the space and time variables are no longer associated together as (x ± vt).

     3. A high frequency (HF) radio receiver receives simultaneously two signals from a transmitter 400 km away, one by a path along the surface of the earth, and the other by reflection from a portion of the ionospheric layer situated at a height of 200 km. We assume that the earth is flat and the ionospheric layer acts as a perfect hori/ontal reflector, which is moving slowly in the vertical direction. When the frequency of the transmitted wave is 10 MH/, it is observed that the combined signal strength varies from maximum to minimum and back to maximum 6 times per minute. With what slow vertical speed is the ionospheric layer moving?
[Ignore atmospheric disturbance]
Solution
     Let d = Length of the direct path along the earth's surface, h = Height of the reflecting ionospheric layer. The path difference p between the two routes (Fig. 6.5) is
p = 2(h2 + d2/4)1/2 - d	...(6.4)
Interference takes place between the signals arriving at the receiver by the two routes. Fluctuation in intensity is due to motion of the ionospheric layer. We have from
Eqn. (6.4)

 dp dt

=  2h h2 ? d2 4 ?1 2  dh ?

     4. An open organ pipe has a fundamental frequency of 300 H/. The third harmonic of a closed organ pipe has the same frequency as the second harmonic of the open pipe. How long is each pipe? [speed of sound in air = 340 m/s]
Solution
     For an open organ pipe, ? = v/? = v/2l1 for fundamental frequency (n = 1) without end- correction.

Thus,	l1

For third harmonic of the closed organ pipe,

Thus,	l2

Solution

For the open pipe, the fundamental frequency is ?1

=  v , where v is the velocity of
2l

sound in air and l = Length of the pipe. For the third harmonic of the closed pipe,




we have

Now,	?3 = ?1 + 100

     6. An organ pipe, open at both ends, sounds in unison with a tuning fork at 20°C. When the tuning fork and the pipe are sounded together at 30°C, 6 beats are heard. Find the frequency n of the fork assuming that it is not affected by the temperature change.
Solution
The velocity of sound in air at t°C is given by
vt = v0 (1 + 0.00183t)
where v0 = Velocity of sound in air at 0°C. Thus,
n = v0 (1 ? 0.00183 ? 20)
2(l ? 2x)
where l = Length of the open pipe and
  x = End-correction At 30°C, we have
n + 6 =  v0 (1 ? 0.00183 ? 30)
2(l ? 2x)
Hence,	n ? 6  =  1 ? 0.00183 ? 30
n	1 ? 0.00183 ? 20
which gives n = 339.87 Hz.
     7. A metallic rod of length 1m is rigidly clamped at its mid-point. Longitudinal stationary waves are set-up in the rod in such a way that there are two nodes on either side of the mid- point. The amplitude of an antinode is 2 × 10-6 m. Write the equation of motion at a point 2 cm from the mid-point and those of the constituent waves in the rod.
[Young's modulus = 2 × 1011 Nm-2, density = 8000 kg m-3]	(I.I.T. 1994)
Solution
Velocity of propagation of longitudinal waves in the rod
= v =	E ? = [2 × 1011/8000]1/2 = 5 × 103 m/s.
     The rod has node at the mid-point and antinodes at the two ends. There are two nodes on either side of the mid-point (Fig. 6.6).

The equation of the standing wave in the rod is

10 10

Thus, A = 0.
The equation of the standing wave is
y = B cos 5?x cos 25000?t.
Since the amplitude at the antinode = 2 × 10-6 m,
B = 2 × 10-6 m.
     Hence,	y = 2 × 10-6 cos 5?x cos 25000?t which can be rewritten as
y = 1 × 10-6 cos (5?x + 25000?t) + 1 × 10-6 cos (5?x - 25000?t)
Hence the component waves are
y1 = 1 × 10-6 cos(5?x + 25000?t)
y2 = 1 × 10-6 cos(5?x - 25000?t)
     At a point 2 cm from the mid-point x = (0.5 ± 0.02) m. The equation of motion at this point is given by
y = 2 × 10-6 cos 5?(0.5 ± 0.02) cos 25000?t

Let yn-1, yn and yn+1 be the transverse displacement of the (n - 1), n and (n + 1)th  bead respectively (Fig. 6.8).

Find the heights of water level (from the bottom of the pipe) at which resonances occur. Neglect end correction. Now, the pipe is filled to a height H (? 3.6 m). A small hole is drilled very close to its bottom and water is allowed to leak. Obtain an expression for the rate of fall of water level in the pipe as a function of H. If the radii of the pipe and the hole are 2 × 10 -2 m and 1 × 10 -3 m respectively, calculate the time interval between the occurrence of first two resonances. Speed of sound in air is 340 m/s and g = 10 m/s2.	(I.I.T. 2000)
Solution
The frequency of the source = 212.5 Hz

and wavelength in air =	340
212.5


= 1.6 m.

     For a pipe closed at one end the length of the air column for resonance should be (2n + 1) ?/4, n = 0, 1, 2,... i.e., ?/4, 3?/4, 5?/4,...
     Again the length of air column must be less than or equal to 3.6 m. Thus the possible lengths of air column are 0.4 m, 1.2 m, 2 m, 2.8 m, 3.6 m.
     Possible heights of water columns are 0 m, 0.8 m, 1.6 m, 2.4 m, 3.2 m from the bottom of the pipe.
Suppose,	dH =  Change of water level in time dt, A = Area of cross-section of the pipe,


v =  Velocity with which the water is going out through the hole,
a =  Area of cross-section of the hole,
then	AdH = - av dt.

     18. The air column in a pipe closed at one end is made to vibrate in its second overtone by a tuning fork of frequency 440 H/. The speed of sound in air is 330 ms-1. End corrections may be neglected. Let P0 denote the mean pressure at any point in the pipe, and ?P0 the maximum amplitude of pressure variation.
(a) Find the length L of the air column.
(b) What is the amplitude of pressure variation at the middle of the column?
(c) What are the maximum and minimum pressures at the open end of the pipe?
(d) What are the maximum and minimum pressures at the closed end of the pipe?
(I.I.T. 1998)
Solution
(a) For the pipe closed at one end we have for frequency
=	v	n, n = 1, 3, 5,....
4 L
where n = 1 for fundamental, n = 3 for first overtone and n = 5 for second overtone.
Thus for second overtone

At x = 0, there is antinode (maximum displacement of air particles) and at x = L,
kx =  5? , there is node.

The amplitude of pressure variation at x = L

is ?P0 .

    (c) At x = 0 (at the open end) there is no variation of the pressure. The maximum and minimum pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure.
     (d) At x = L (at the closed end of the pipe) there is variation of pressure due to pressure amplitude variation ± ?p0. Hence the maximum pressure at the closed end = p0 + ?p0 and the minimum pressure = p0 - ?p0.

Solution
Allowed frequencies of an open organ pipe are

?  =	v

n, n = 1, 2, 3,....

Allowed frequencies of a closed organ pipe are
v
?c =  4 l2  n, n = 1, 3, 5,....

Thus,	v . 2

20. The displacement of the medium in a sound wave is given by the equation
y1 = A cos (ax + bt)
where A, a and b are positive constants. The wave is reflected by an obstacle situated at x = 0. The intensity of the reflected wave is 0.64 time that of the incident wave.
(a) What are the wavelength and frequency of incident wave?
(b) Write the equation for the reflected wave.
     (c) In the resultant wave formed after reflection, find the maximum and minimum values of the particle speeds in the medium.
     (d) Express the resultant wave as a superposition of a standing wave and travelling wave. What are the positions of the antinodes of the standing wave? What is the direction of propagation of travelling wave?	(I.I.T. 1991)
Solution
(a) The general form of a travelling wave is given by
y = A cos (kx + ?t)
Comparing with the given equation, we get
k = a and ? = b

(b) The amplitude of the reflected wave = 0.8A so that its intensity is 0.64A2.
     It is moving in the opposite direction of the incident wave. The reflected and incident waves are 180° out of phase. Thus the equation of the reflected wave is
y2 = -0.8A cos (-ax + bt)
= -0.8A cos (ax - bt)
(c) The resultant wave is given by
y = y1 + y2 = A cos (ax + bt) - 0.8A cos (ax - bt)




The particle velocity is


??y
?t



= -Ab sin (ax + bt) - 0.8Ab sin (ax - bt)
= -1.8Ab sin ax cos bt - 0.2Ab cos ax  sin bt

     The maximum value of the particle velocity is obtained when sin ax = 1, cos bt = 1 and then cos ax = 0 and sin bt = 0.

??y
?t max

=	?1.8 Ab  = 1.8Ab m/s.

The minimum value of the particle velocity is obtained when sin ax = 0 and sin bt = 0,
??y	=  0
?t min
(d) The resultant wave is
y =  y1 + y2 = A cos (ax + bt) - 0.8A cos (ax - bt)
=  A cos (ax + bt) - A cos (ax - bt) + 0.2A cos (ax - bt)
=  -2A sin ax cos bt + 0.2A cos (ax - bt).
     The first term on the r.h.s. is the standing wave and the second term is the travelling wave. Thus the resultant wave is expressed as the superposition of standing wave and travelling wave.
The positions of the antinodes of the standing wave are obtained when sin ax = ± 1

where	f = Frequency of the tuning fork = 512 Hz
v = Speed of sound
l1 = Length of air column at first resonance
l2 = Length of air column at second resonance
x = End correction.

Thus,	l2

The error in v is



Correct Choice : c.

v = 2f (l2 - l1 )

?v = 2f ? (l2 - l1)

For closed organ pipe

(c) Obtain the relation ?E ?t ? h for our waves, where ?E = uncertainty in the energy of the
pulse and ?t = uncertainty in time.
Solution
(a) For large ?0 only the first term of Eqn. (7.28) will be of any importance when
? ? ?0. This is shown in Fig. 7.7.

uncertainty in the energy of the pulse. There is also uncertainty in the time. A cycle of the wave requires a time 2?/?0 to pass through a point. Thus, the wave of N cycles requires a time N2?/?0 to pass through a point. We may take
?t =  N  2? .

Find the frequency distribution |g(?)|2 of the electromagnetic oscillation. Show schematically on a diagram how |g(?)|2 vs ? behaves as ? is increased from small values to very high values.

     For small ? (damping of the electromagnetic wave is large), the value of the peak of the frequency distribution is small and ?? is large. As ? increases (damping of the electromagnetic wave decreases), the peak value increases and ?? decreases i.e., the frequency distribution curve becomes more peaked and sharper.

Derive the Parseval's relation
g * (p) g (p) dp
??

8.1 TRANSVERSE VIBRATION OF A STRING FIXED AT TWO ENDS
The normal mode frequencies of transverse waves on a string of length l which is under tension T and is fixed at two ends are given by


?n =

n = 1, 2, 3,....,	...(8.1)


where µ is the mass per unit length of the string. For the fundamental mode, n = 1 and higher values of n correspond to higher harmonics (overtones).

8.2 PLUCKED STRING
A string which is fixed at both ends and is under some tension, is plucked at some point to a small height and then released from rest. The string then executes small transverse vibration.

8.3 STRUCK STRING
A perfectly flexible string which is fixed at both ends and is under some tension, is struck by a hammer at a point, the time of contact between the string and the hammer being very very small. The force given by the hammer is of the nature of an impulse and it imparts initially (t = 0) a velocity to the point struck but all other points have zero velocity. We investigate the motion of the string at later times.

8.4 BOWED STRING
We study the motion of the violin string when bowed at some point. The string is fixed at both ends and is under some tension.
     Characteristics of a bowed string: For maintained vibration of the bowed string, Helmholtz observed the following characteristics:
(i) The bowed point moves with the same velocity as that of the bow.




    (ii) All points of the string vibrate in a plane at	y any instant. The motion of any point on the string consists of an ascent with uniform forward velocity followed by a descent with another uniform backward velocity. The two velocities are equal in magnitude
at the middle point of the string.
     The displacement-time graph of a point on the string can be represented as two step zig-zag straight lines (Fig. 8.1). Here, the point under observation moves forward with constant velocity for the time AB = T1 and moves backward with another constant velocity for the time BC = T2. The time period of vibration ? = T1 + T2 = AC.

The deflection u (x, y, t) for small transverse vibration of the membrane satisfies the two-dimensional wave equation

1. Derive the formula given in Eqn. (8.1).
Solution
     Since the string is fixed at its ends, each end must be stationary and therefore nodes are produced at the two ends. Again, the string must be an integral number of half-wavelengths in length (Fig. 8.2):

l = n ? n , n = 1, 2, 3, ...

where ?n is the wavelength of the nth normal mode.
The frequency of the nth mode is

     2. A string of length l = 0.5 m and mass per unit length 0.01 kgm-1 has a fundamental frequency of 250 H/. What is the tension in the string?
Solution
We have

     3. Two wires of radii r and 2r respectively are welded together end to end. This combination is used as a sonometer wire kept under tension T. The welded point is midway between the two bridges. What would be the ratio of the number of loops formed in the wires such that the joint is a node when stationary vibrations are set up in the wires.	(I.I.T. 1976)
Solution
Let n1 and n2 be the number of loops formed in the wires of radii r and 2r respectively.
Then

?1 =	and ?2 ?	.

     4. A metal wire of diameter 1 mm is held on two knife edges separated by a distance of 50 cm. The tension in the wire is 100 N. The wire vibrating with its fundamental frequency and a vibrating tuning fork together produce 5 beats/sec. The tension in the wire is then reduced to 81 N. When the two are excited, beats are heard at the same rate. Calculate (i) the frequency of the fork and (ii) the density of the material of wire.	(I.I.T. 1980)
Solution
     Let the frequency of the tuning fork be n. When tension in the wire is 100 N, the fundamental frequency of the wire is n + 5, and when T = 81 N, the fundamental frequency of the wire is n - 5, so that 5 beats/sec are produced in both the cases. Thus,


n + 5 =

? 10




n - 5 =

? 9 .


On solving these two equations, we get
n = 95 Hz, µ = 0.01 kg/m.

     5. A string 25 cm long and having a mass of 2.5 g is under tension. A pipe closed at one end is 40 cm long. When the string is vibrating in its first overtone and the air in the pipe in its fundamental frequency, 8 beats per second are heard. It is observed that decreasing the tension in the string decreases the beat frequency. If the speed of sound in air is 320 m/s, find the tension in the string.	(I.I.T. 1982)
Solution
The fundamental frequency of the closed pipe is

?  =	v ?
1	4l

320


4 ? 0.4

? 200 Hz.

     The frequency of the vibrating string is 208 Hz so that with decrease in tension of the string the frequency of the string decreases and the beat frequency also decreases.
The first overtone of the string is

208 =
or	T = 208 × 208 × l2 ?
= 208 × 208 × l2 × (m/l)
where	l = 25 cm = 0.25 m
and	m = 2.5 g = 2.5 × 10-3 kg.
Thus,	T = 27.04 N.
     6. A sonometer wire fixed at one end has a solid mass M hanging from its other end to produce tension in it. It is found that a 70 cm length of the wire produces a certain fundamental frequency when plucked. When the same mass M is hanging in water, completely submerged in it, it is found that the length of the wire has to be changed by 5 cm in order that it will produce the same fundamental frequency. Calculate the density of the material of the mass M hanging from the wire.	(I.I.T 1972)
Solution
The fundamental frequency of the sonometer wire is

? =	?	.

     When M is submerged in water completely, the tension in the wire decreases to [M - M/?] g, where ? is the density of the material of the mass M. The frequency remains the same for a length of 65 cm. Hence,

? =




From these two equations, we have
	M	 =

     7. A steel wire of length 1 m, mass 0.1 kg and uniform cross sectional area 10-6 m2 is rigidly fixed at both ends. The temperature of the wire is lowered by 20°C. If transverse waves are set up by plucking the string in the middle, calculate the frequency of the fundamental mode of vibration.
Young's modulus of steel = 2 × 1011 N/m2,
Coefficient of linear expansion of steel = 1.21 × 10-5/?C.	(I.I.T. 1984)
Solution
Change in length dl of the wire when the temperature is lowered by 20°C is
dl = l × ? × 20 = 1 × 1.21 × 10-5 × 20
= 2.42 × 10-4 m.
Now,	Y =

     Let ?S be the element in the displaced position (Fig. 8.3). The work done against the tension T when the element is stretched is the potential energy of the element.

We assume that the y-displacement of the string is small so that

Here, we neglect the increase in tension of the string when it is stretched.
     9. If a wave of the form y = f (u) with u = x - vt moves along the string under tension T with velocity v, show that the instantaneous power passing any position x is given by

Since the wave moves with velocity v, the instantaneous power passing any position x is
P = vE1 = vT [f ?(u)]2.
     10. Using the following general expression for the power that passes any position x along the string
P = FV,
where F = y - component of the force = -T ??y ,
?x
V = the transverse velocity = ??y ,

[Note : The ratio F/V =	is called the wave impedance or, the characteristic
impedance (/) of a transverse wave on the string. This expression is analogous with the electrical impedance = voltage/current, while electric power = voltage × current. Voltage and current are the electrical analogous of the mechanical force and displacement velocity.]

    13. Consider the motion of the transverse waves on a long string consisting of two parts. The left part has a linear mass density µ1 and the right part a different linear mass density µ2 with both parts under the same tension T Fig. 8.4
     For convenience, we place the x-origin at the discontinuity. Suppose that a source of sinusoidal waves on the negative x-axis is sending waves toward the discontinuity and that the waves continue past it are absorbed with no reflection by a distant sink. Find the power reflection and transmission coefficients at the
point of discontinuity.	T

Fig. 8.4


Solution
     There are two independent boundary conditions at the point of discontinuity where the two strings are joined;
(i) Continuity of the displacement of the string:
                            yleft = yright at x = 0 for all times. (otherwise they would not be joined together)
     (ii) Continuity of the transverse force in the string: If the force is not continuous at the boundary, an infinitesimal mass therefore would be subject to a finite force, resulting in an infinite acceleration, which is not possible. Thus, we have

?T ??y
?x




left

=  ?T ??y
?x right


at x = 0 for all times,



or,	??y
?x




left

=  ??y
?x right


at x = 0 for all times,

Let us take the incident wave coming from the left to be the real part of
                                y1 = A1 exp [i(k1x - ?t)], -? < x < 0. which has the amplitude A1 and the velocity v1 = ?/k1 =
The wave transmitted past the discontinuity is assumed to be the real part of
                                y2 = A2 exp [i(k2 x - ?t)], 0 < x < ?, which has the amplitude A2 and the velocity v2 = ?/k2 =
Both the waves must necessarily have the same frequency.
     There must exist a third wave that is reflected from the boundary. We assume that the reflected wave travelling to the left is the real part of
y1? = B1 exp [i(-k1x - ?t)], -? < x < 0,
which is moving towards the negative direction. The reflected wave has the amplitude B1 and the wave number k1 which is appropriate to the string on the left side of the boundary.
The boundary conditions (i) and (ii) now give
A1 + B1 = A2
-T(ik1 A1) + T(ik1B1) = -T(ik2 A2)
From these two equations, we get
A  =	2k1	A
2	k1 ? k2	1


and	B1

= k1 ? k2 A1 k1 ? k2

Thus, we have
Amplitude reflection coefficient	= R

Amplitude transmission coefficient = T

The characteristic impedances of the two parts of the string are:
/1 = µ1v1 =
                                /2 = µ2v2 = and the wave numbers k1 and k2 are given by

k  =  ??

Thus, we get	Ra

/1 ? /2



T	=	2/1

     We find that both Ra and Ta are real. If µ1 > µ2, Ra is positive which implies that the reflected wave has the same phase as the incident wave. If µ1< µ2, Ra is negative showing that the reflected and incident waves are 180° out of phase. Ta is always positive showing that the transmitted wave has the same phase as the incident wave.
Next, we define the power reflection coefficient Rp and power transmission coefficient
T . The power carried by a travelling wave is 1 µv?2A2. Thus, we may define

p	2
1 ?1v1?2 B2
Power reflection coefficient = R  =  2	1

? v A2

(/ ? / )

     We see that Rp + Tp = 1, showing that the incident power equals the reflected power plus the transmitted power. Since Rp and Tp depend only on the properties of the string and not on the frequency and amplitude of the waves, the expressions (8.3) and (8.4) must hold for waves of arbitrary shape.


     14. A perfectly elastic string of length l which is under tension T and is fixed at both ends, has the linear mass density (i.e., mass per unit length) ?. The string is given initial deflection and initial velocity at its various points and is released at time t = 0. The string executes small transverse vibrations. The initial deflection and the initial velocity of the string at any point x are denoted by h (x) and V (x) respectively. Find the different normal modes of vibrations and the deflection of the string at any point x and at any time t > 0.

We have to solve the wave equation

with	v =

(ii) y(l, t) = 0	...(8.7)
(iii) y(x, 0) = h(x)	...(8.8)
??y
(iv) ?x t = 0 = V(x)	...(8.9)
(v) |y(x, t)| < M	...(8.10)
where M is a fixed number i.e. the motion is bounded.
     Solution of Eqn. (8.5) by the method of separation of variables: We assume that y (x, t) can be written as
y(x, t) = F(x) G(t)
where F (x) is a function of x only and G (t) is a function of t only. Substituting in Eqn. (8.5), we get
d2G	d2 F
F dt2	= v2 G dx2
1	d2G	1 d2 F

or	v2G dt2	=  F dx2

...(8.11)

     L.H.S. of Eqn. (8.11) is a function of t only and the R.H.S of Eqn. (8.11) is a function of x only. Since Eqn. (8.11) is true for all values of x and t, the two sides of Eqn. (8.11) must be equal to a constant, independent of x and t. This constant should also be negative on physical grounds, |y(x, t)|< M (i.e., the displacement is bounded). If it were a positive
constant q, then G (t) would be G (t) ~ exp (±	v2 q t ). The positive sign in the exponential
is not allowed since it would mean growing displacement and the negative sign is	not acceptable since there is no damping force in the system. Thus, we have
1 d2G	1 d2 F

v2G dt2
where -p2 is the separation constant.
The solution for F(x) is

=  F dx2

= - p2

F(x) = A cos px + B sin px.


The boundary conditions of Eqns. (8.6) and (8.7) give
A = 0 and B sin pl = 0,
or	pl = n?, n = 1, 2, 3,...
or	p = n?/l
For any particular n, we have
Fn(x) = Bn sin(n?x/l).
     For different values of n we obtain different solutions. In fact there are infinitely many solutions. For a particular n, the differential equation for G (t) is



where ?n = N?v/l.

The general solution of this equation is
Gn(t) = Dn? cos ?nt + E?n sin ?nt.
Thus, the displacement for the nth mode is

where	Dn = BnDn? and En = Bn En? .
     We have obtained the solutions yn (x, t) of the partial differential Eqn. (8.5) satisfying the boundary conditions (8.6), (8.7) and (8.10). The functions yn (x, t) are called the eigenfunctions or characteristic functions and the values ?n = n?v/l are called the eigen frequencies or characteristic frequencies of the vibrating string. Each yn represents a harmonic motion having the angular frequency ?n = 2??n, where

     The motion is called the nth normal mode of the string. The first normal mode (n = 1) is known as the fundamental mode, and higher modes (n = 2, 3, 4, ...) as overtones.

     Equation (8.12) gives the nth normal mode solution of Eqn. (8.5) satisfying the boundary conditions (8.6), (8.7) and (8.10). The sum of infinitely many solutions yn(x, t) is also a solution. Therefore, the general solution is

    16. A perfectly elastic string of length l	y which is under tension T and is fixed at both ends, has mass per unit length ?. It is plucked
at the point x = a to a height h (Fig. 8.8) and then released from rest. The string executes small transverse vibration. Find the different normal modes of vibrations and the deflection of the string at any point x at any later time.
Solution
Initially we have triangular deflection:  O

For 0 ? x ? a,	 y h

For a ? x ? l,  y
h

=  l ? x , or
l ? a

y ?  h(l ? x).

Thus, at time t = 0, the deflection of the string is given by

     18. A perfectly flexible string of length l and linear mass density ?, which is fixed at both ends and is under tension T, is struck by a pointed hammer at the point x = a, the time of contact between the string and the hammer being very very small. Write the wave equation and the proper boundary conditions of this problem of struck string. Find the deflection of the string at any point x at a later time.

Cince the string is perfectly flexible, the point, say x = a, where the hammer strikes is

not at rest, though other points are at rest initially i.e., Jj ?y7j	? y? ? 0
(t ? 0)


at x = a and


y?0 = 0 

when x ? a. In this case, there is initial motion, but no initial displacement i.e., y (x, 0) = 0. Thus, we have to solve the wave equation.

of transverse wave on the string and ? (x - a) is the Dirac delta function having the definition
?(x - a) = 0 when x ? a
? 0 when x = a.

     Note: In practice, the results for the vibration of struck string are to be modified because of finite time of contact between the hammer and the string and also because the area under the hammer is finite.

     20. Derive the partial differential equation for small transverse vibrations of a thin stretched membrane.
Solution
We make the following assumptions regarding the vibrations of the membrane:
(i) The mass of the membrane ? per unit area is constant.
(ii) The membrane is perfectly flexible.
(iii) The membrane is stretched and then fixed along its entire boundary in the xy-plane. The tension T per unit length caused by stretching of the membrane is the same at all points and in all directions.
(iv) The deflection u (x, y, t) of the membrane during its motion is small compared with the size of the membrane, and all angles of inclination are small. The tension T does not change appreciably during the motion.
     We consider small transverse vibrations of a thin membrane. We find the forces acting on a small portion (Fig. 8.10) whose sides are approximately equal to ?x and ?y.
     The forces acting on the edges of the portion are T?x and T?y which are tangent to the membrane. The horizontal components of the forces are obtained by multiplying the forces by the cosines of the angles of inclination. The cosines of the angles are close to one. Hence the horizontal components of the forces at opposite edges are approximately equal and opposite. Thus, there will be no appreciable motion of the particles of the membrane in the horizontal direction.
The resultant of the vertical components of the forces along the edges parallel to the
yu-plane is (Fig. 8.10).

21. (a) Consider a stretched thin rectangular membrane of sides a and b which is fixed along its entire boundary. Write the differential equation for small transverse vibrations of the membrane with proper boundary conditions. Solve the problem and discuss the nature of vibrations.
(b) Consider the vibrations of a square membrane for which a = b = 1 and discuss the nature of the nodal lines.


Solution	y
    (a) We consider small transverse vibrations of the rectangular membrane (Fig. 8.11). The initial deflection and the initial velocity of the membrane at any point (x, y) are denoted by f (x, y) and g (x, y)
respectively.	b
     We have to solve the two-dimensional wave equation

(iii) ??u

(iv) |u (x, y, t)| < M
where M is a fixed number i.e., the motion is bounded.
We apply the method of separation of variables to the wave equation (8.18) and assume
u(x, y, t) = F(x, y) G(t).	...(8.19)
Substituting Eqn. (8.19) into Eqn. (8.18), we get

?2 F y

v2G dt2

= F jL ?x2

? ?y2 jQ

...(8.20)

     Since L.H.S. of Eqn. (8.20) is a function of t only and the R.H.S. is a function of x and y, the two sides must be equal to a constant. This constant should also be negative which gives solution with proper boundary conditions. Thus, we may write

1  d2G

?2 F y



The equation for F is

We apply the method of separation of variables and write
F(x, y) = H(x) W(y)	...(8.23)
Substituting Eqn. (8.23) into Eqn. (8.22), we get

d2 H

d2W	2

W dx2	= -H

dy2

? p HW.


Dividing both sides by HW, we obtain

1 d2 H

1 J d2W	2  7

H dx2

= - W jH dy2

? p WjJ

...(8.24)

     Since L.H.S. is a function of x only and R.H.S. is a function of y only, the two sides must be equal to a constant. This constant should be negative on physical grounds.

1 d2 H

1 J d2W	2  7


H dx2

= - W jH dy2

? p WjJ = - q2.

This gives two ordinary  differential equations:
d2 H ? q2 H



dx2
and	d2W 

= 0	...(8.25)

r2W  = 0	...(8.26)

dy2 ?
where	r2 = p2 - q2 .
The general solutions of Eqns. (8.25) and (8.26) are
H(x) = A cos qx + B sin qx, W(y) = C cos ry + D sin ry,
where A, B, C and D are constants. From the boundary condition (i) it follows that F (x, y) = H(x) W(y) must be zero on the boundary. Thus, we have
H(0) = 0, H(a) = 0, W(0) = 0 and W(b) = 0.
Hence,	H(0) = A = 0 and H(a) = B sin qa = 0.
We must take B ? 0 since otherwise H(x) ? 0 and F ? 0 which corresponds to no
deflection of membrane for all time. Hence sin qa = 0 or, q =  m? where m is an integer.

Similarly, C = 0 and r = n? where n is an integer. Thus, the solutions are
b
H (x) = sin  m?x and W (y) = sin  n?y
m	a	n	b
with m = 1, 2,...., and n = 1, 2,..... It is not necessary to consider m, n = -1, -2,	, because
the corresponding solutions are essentially the same as for positive m and n, except for a factor -1. Thus the functions

(x) W (y) = sin m?x

sin  n?y

mn	m	n	a	b
with m, n = 1, 2, 3,....
are solutions of Eqn. (8.22) which satisfy the boundary conditions (i) and (iv). Since

     The deflection at any point (x, y) and at any time t is given by Eqn. (8.27) where the coefficients Kmn and Lmn are obtained from Eqns. (8.28) and (8.29).
(b) Here a = b = 1 and the eigenvalues are
?mn = v? [m2 + n2]1/2 = ?nm.
For m ? n, the corresponding functions.
Fmn = sin m?x sin n?y and Fnm = sin n?x sin m?y are different. For example, ?12 = ?21

     The nodal lines of the eigenfunctions u11, u12, u21, u22, u13 and u31 of the square membrane are shown in Fig. 8.12.
Taking K12 = 1 and L12 = L21 = 0, we obtain
u12 + u21 = cos v?	5t (F12 + K21 F21)

which also represents a vibrational mode with frequency ?12 =

     The nodal line of this mode of vibration is the solution of the equation

Kmn = 4B	sin ?x sin 2?y sin m?x sin n?y dx dy

u(x, y, t) = B cos ?  5 t sin ?x sin 2?y.
     23. Consider a stretched thin circular membrane of radius R, which is fixed along its entire boundary. Write the partial differential equation in polar coordinates for small transverse vibrations of the membrane. Find the deflection u(r, t) of the membrane when the initial deflection and initial velocity are given by
u(r, 0) = f (r)
??u
= g(r)
t ? 0
Solution
The two-dimensional wave equation
?2u

?t2

= v2 ?2 u

takes the following form in polar coordinates.
?2u	r?2u	1 ?u	1 ?2u y
?t2	= v2 jL?r2 ? r ?r ? r2 ??2 jQ.
     We shall consider only those solutions u (r, t) of this equation which are radially symmetric i.e., independent of ?. The wave equation then reduces to

?2u

r?2u	1 ?u y

= v2 j  2 ?	j

...(8.30)

?t2

jL?r	r ?r jQ


We have to solve this equation under the following boundary conditions:
(i) u(R, t) = 0 for all t ? 0
(ii) u(r, 0) = f (r)
??u

(iii) 

= g(r)
t ? 0

(iv) |u(r, t)| < M
where M is a fixed number i.e., the motion is bounded.
We apply the method of separation of variables to Eqn. (8.30) and assume
u(r, t) = H(r) G(t).
Substituting this equation into Eqn. (8.30) and dividing the resulting equation by v2 HG,
we get

1  d2G
1 
rd2 H

1 dH y

v2G dt2

= H jL dr2

? r dr jQ.

     Since L.H.S. is a function of t only and the R.H.S. is a function of r only, the two sides must be equal to a constant. This constant should be negative in order to give a solution with proper boundary conditions. Thus, we have

1  d2G

1 rd2 H

1 dH y



The equation for H is

v2G dt2

= H jL dr2

? r dr jQ

= - p2

d2 H


dr2

? 1 dH r dr


+ p2 H = 0.	...(8.31)

We introduce a new variable s = pr so that

dH dr
d2 H

=  dH ds
ds dr
d2 H

= p dH .
ds

and

dr2	= p2

ds2 .

In the new variable s, Eqn. (8.31) becomes
d2 H ? 1 dH

ds2

s ds

+ H = 0.

This is Bessel's equation of order zero. The general solution of this equation is
H = c1J0(s) + c2Y0(s)
where c1 and c2 are two arbitrary constants and J0(s) and Y0(s) are the Bessel functions of the first and second kind of order zero. Since the deflection of the membrane is always finite, we cannot use Y0(s) as Y0(s) becomes infinite when s approaches zero. Hence, we put c2 = 0.
Clearly c1 ? 0 since otherwise H = 0. We may set c1 = 1 and write
H(r) = J0(pr).	...(8.32)


On the boundary r = R we must have boundary condition (i):
u(R, t) = H(R)G(t) = 0.
Since G ? 0 would imply u ? 0 for all r and t, we must have
H(R) = J0(pR) = 0.
Denoting the positive zeros of J0(pR) by
pR = ?1, ?2, ?3,...
We obtain	p =  ?m , m ? 1, 2, 3,....
R
The first four positive zeros of J0(pR) are given below:
?1 = 2.405, ?2 = 5.520, ?3 = 8.654, ?4 = 11.792.
Hence, the functions
H	(r) = J Jj? m rj7 , m = 1, 2, 3,...
m	0 H R  J
are solutions of Eqn. (8.31) which vanish at r = R. The corresponding differential equation for G (t) is
d2Gm ? v2? 2 G

R2	m  = 0

which has the general solution


Gm(t) = am cos ?m t + bm sin ?mt,

Nodal Lines: The nodal lines are obtained from the zeroes of Hm (r).


For m = 1, J

Jj ?1r7j = 0 when r = R i.e., the circular membrane is fixed at its boundary.

There is no nodal line of the membrane. All the points of the membrane move upward (or downward) at the same time.

The concentric circles r = ?1R/?3 and r = ?2 R/?3 are the nodal lines.
     The nodal lines of the circular membrane for the normal modes m = 1, 2, 3 are shown in Fig. 8.14.

From the boundary condition (ii), we have

     Then, am is the coefficient of the Fourier-Bessel series which represents f (r) in terms of J0 (?m r/R). Thus, we have

9.1 DOPPLER SHIFT
If the observer or the source or both are in motion then the observer notes an apparent change in frequency from the actual frequency of the wave emitted by the source. This phenomenon is called the Doppler effect and the difference between the actual and observed frequency or wavelength is known as Doppler shift. When both the source and the observer are in motion along the same straight line (Fig. 9.1), the moving observer will receive a wave whose apparent frequency fos is given by

fos

= f v ? vo
v ? vs

...(9.1)



S	O
Fig. 9.1
Here,	f = Actual frequency of the wave emitted by the source through the medium which is at rest,
v = Velocity of the wave through the medium which is at rest,
vo = Velocity of the observer (away from the source) with respect to the medium,
vs  = Velocity of the source (towards the observer) with respect to the medium.
We may consider the following special cases:
     (i) When the source is at rest (vs = 0) and the observer is moving away from the source, the apparent frequency is
f  = f v ? vo , f < f
o v	o
     (ii) When the source is at rest (vs = 0) and the observer is moving towards the source, the apparent frequency is
f  = f v ? vo , f > f
o v	o
     (iii) When the observer is at rest (vo = 0) and the source is moving towards the observer, the apparent frequency is

f  = f	v
s	v ? vs

, fs > f


     (iv) When the observer is at rest (vo = 0) and the source is moving away from the observer, the apparent frequency is

f  = f	v
s	v ? vs


, fs

< f  and  ?s

> ?,

v
where the apparent wavelength ?s =
s

and the actual wavelength ? = v .
f

     When the light from a star is examined spectroscopically, it is found to contain the
spectra of common terrestrial elements, but the spectral lines are shifted towards the red end of the spectrum. If the star is moving away from the earth, it is clear that ?s > ? and the observed 'red shift' can be explained.
     In solving numerical problems Eqn. (9.1) should be remembered. The direction of sound is always taken as the direction from the source towards the observer. The velocity measured in the direction of sound is taken as positive while that in the opposite direction is taken as negative. When the observer moves toward the source, or, the source moves toward the observer or both move toward each other, the apparent frequency increases. In the other case when the observer moves away from the source, or the source moves away from the observer, or, both move away from each other, the apparent frequency decreases.


     1. (a) When the source is at rest and the observer is moving towards the source, show that the moving observer will receive a wave whose apparent frequency fo is given by
f = f v ? vo o	v
where f = actual frequency of the wave emitted by the source, v = velocity of the wave through the medium which is at rest, vo = velocity of the observer (towards the source) with respect to the medium.
(b) What will happen when the observer is moving away from the source?
Solution
     (a) The observer O is moving with velocity vo towards the stationary source S (Fig. 9.2). The source S is emitting waves which are travelling through the medium with velocity v.
vo
O	S
Fig. 9.2
     Then, we have v = f ?, where ? is the wavelength of the wave, which is the distance between adjacent crests. If the observer were at rest he would have received f number of crests in unit time. Since the observer is moving towards the source he will receive more number of crests in unit time. The increase in the number of crests received by the observer in unit time is vo/?. Thus, the apparent frequency fo is
f  = f + vo ? f ? vo f ? f v ? vo	(9.2)
o	?	v	v


     (b) When the observer is moving away from the source, the apparent frequency as received by the observer is

fo =  f ? vo
?

? f v ? vo	(9.3)

     2. (a) When the observer is at rest and the source is in motion towards the observer show that the apparent frequency as received by the observer is
f  =  f	v	.
s	v ? vs
       (b) What is the apparent frequency when the source is moving away from a stationary observer?
Solution
(a) When the source is at rest, the successive wave crests emitted by it are one wavelength
? apart. When the source is moving towards the observer, the distance between adjacent crests is decreased by the distance the source travels in one cycle. The time taken in one
1
cycle is f  and the distance traversed by the source in one cycle is vs/f. Thus, the apparent

wavelength ?s is given by


?  = ? - vs ?  v ? vs ?  1 (v ? vs ).
	

s	f	f	f	f
     But, since the medium in which the wave is being propagated is at rest, the wave velocity remains unchanged, so that the frequency of the signal received by the stationary observer is

f  =	v
s	? s

?		vf v ? vs

(b) The apparent frequency when the source is moving away from the observer is

f  =	vf

     3. When the source and the observer are in motion along the same straight line as shown in Fig. 9.1, show that the moving observer will receive a wave whose apparent frequency fos is given by Eqn. (9.1).
Solution
     When the source is moving towards the stationary observer it gives rise to a wave whose apparent frequency fs is given by Eqn. (9.4). If we take fs to be the frequency of the
wave itself, we need not concern ourselves further with the motion of the source. The moving observer will receive a wave whose apparent frequency fos is obtained by substituting fs for
f in the right hand side of Eqn. (9.3).

     4. (a) Show that if in the problem 3, vs and vo are both small compared with v, the fractional change in frequency ? f/f is given by (vs - vo)/v. (b) Assuming that the result (a) is also applicable to the Doppler effect of light, show that ?f/f = vs/c or, ??/? = vs/c when the observer is at rest and vs << c, where c is the velocity of light.




Solution
(a) We have from Eqn. (9.1)




f	= f v ? vo ? f 1 ? vo /v

	
os	v ? vs	1 ? vs /v
   ? f(1 - vo/v)(1 + vs/v) fos ? f(1 - vo/v + vs/v)
Thus,	fos - f = ?f = f(vs/v - vo/v)
Hence,	?f/f = (vs - vo)/v	...(9.6)

     5. Show that the Doppler effect is greater when the source approaches a stationary observer than when the observer approaches the stationary source with the same velocity.
Solution
     When the source approaches the stationary observer with velocity vs, the apparent frequency is
f  =  f	v	.
s	v ? vs
     When the observer approaches the stationary source with the velocity vs, the apparent frequency is

Hence,	fs >  fo.

The apparent frequency when the source is approaching the observer, is
f  = f	v	.

The apparent frequency when the source is going away from the observer, is

     9. A source emitting a sinusoidal sound wave of frequency 480 H/ travels towards a wall at a speed 15 m s-1. Find the beat frequency perceived by an observer moving at a speed 10 ms-1 under the following situations, if the speed of sound in air is 330 m s-1:
(i) the observer is going away from the source and the wall (Fig. 9.3).
(ii) the observer is travelling towards the source and the wall.
(iii) the observer is in between the wall and the source, and moving away from the wall.
(iv) the observer is in between the wall and the source, and moving towards the wall.




Solution

Fig. 9.3

(i) First we consider the sound travelling directly from the source (S) to the observer
(O) [Fig. 9.3].
The frequency received by O is


fos

= f v ? vo
v ? vs

= 480 × 320
345


= 445.2 Hz.

     The observer will also receive the sound reflected from the wall. Suppose at any instant, S? is the image of S behind the wall (Fig. 9.3). The image S? is moving at a speed 15 m s-1 towards the observer. We may consider S? as the source of the reflected sound wave. Thus, the frequency perceived by O due to the reflected wave is


f?os

= 480 × 330 ? 10
330 ? 15


= 487.6 Hz.

The beat frequency = 487.6 - 445.2 = 42.4 Hz.
     (ii) The frequencies perceived by O due to the waves from the source and the reflected waves are


fos

The beat frequency = 518.1 - 473.0 = 45.1 Hz.




(iii) The apparent frequencies are

The beat frequency = 518.1 - 487.6 = 30.5 Hz.
(iv) The apparent frequencies are

The vibrating portion of the sonometer wire has a length of 10 cm and a mass of one gm. The vibrating tuning fork is now moved away from the vibrating wire with a constant speed and an observer standing near sonometer hears one beat per second. Calculate the speed with which the tuning fork is moved, if the velocity of sound in air is 300 m s-1.	(I.I.T. 1983)

The girl and the engine move together with the same speed: v0 = vs = 10 m s-1.
(i) If the engine is in front of the compartment carrying the girl, she hears the frequency

     (b) If the wind blows from the source towards the listener with a velocity v?, then the effective velocity of sound = v + v?. Thus, the uncle hears the frequency

10.1 REVERBERATION
If a loud sound wave is produced in an ordinary room with good reflecting walls, the wave undergoes a large number of reflections at the walls. The repeated reflections produce persistence of sound-this phenomenon is called reverberation. In an auditorium or classroom excessive reverberation is not desirable. However, some reverberation is necessary in a concert hall.

10.2 TIME OF REVERBERATION
It is the time required by the energy density to fall to the minimum audibility value (E) from an initial steady value 106E (i.e. million times minimum audibility) when the source of the sound wave is removed. The optimum time of reverberation is about 0.5 s for a medium sized room, 0.8 s to 1.5 s for an auditorium, 1 s to 2 s for a music room and greater than 2 s for a temple.

10.3 SABINE'S LAW
From a large number of experiments Sabine has given the following equation for the time of reverberation (T):
T = K V
a
where K is a constant, V is the volume of the enclosure and a is the total absorption power of all surfaces. The latter is measured in unit Sabin. Again, a = S -a , where S is the total
surface area in sq. ft. and a is the mean absorption coefficient. The absorption coefficient is the fraction of the energy absorbed to the energy incident on the surface. For an open window, absorption coefficient = 1. For marble, the absorption coefficient is found to be 0.01
i.e. it absorbs only 1% of the sound energy at each incidence.

10.4 DECIBEL (dB) UNIT OF SOUND LEVEL
Instead of speaking of the intensity I of a sound wave, it is found to be more convenient to speak of a sound level ?, which is defined as


F I I

? = 10 log

GH Io JK

dB,

where Io is the standard reference intensity = 10-12 W/m2 that is near the lower limit of human audibility. When I = Io, ? = 0. Thus, the threshold audibility corresponds to zero decibel.


     1. Discuss the theory of growth and decay of sound in a 'live room' and find an expression for the reverberation time.
Solution
     In a 'live room', the absorption coefficient of the material of the walls of the room is small (less than 0.4) so that there is increase in loudness of sound due to reverberation.
     Growth of sound energy-Suppose that there is a source of sound of constant output in a live room. Due to reverberation, initially the energy density of the sound increases and after sometime it attains a maximum value. We shall find an expression of the intensity of sound energy in the enclosure at any time under the following assumptions:
(i) the source emits sound energy at a constant rate.
(ii) the sound propagates in all possible directions.
(iii) there is uniform distribution of energy inside the room.
     Consider an elementary area dS on the wall and an elementary volume dV inside the room at a distance r from the surface dS (Fig. 10.1). The normal to the surface dS makes an angle ? with the direction of r. In the spherical polar coordinate system, we have
dV = r2 sin ? d? d? dr.
Let the solid angle subtended by dS at the elementary vloume be d?,
d? =   dS cos? .
r2
     Let the energy density inside the room be E at any time. Then the energy contained in the volume dV is EdV which propagates in all directions.

Out of this energy, the amount that is directed towards the soild angle d? is
 d? EdV =   E dS cos? . r2 sin ? d? d? dr.

I =  Ev 
4

...(10.1)

     If the interior of the walls is made of different materials of areas, ds1, ds2,..., with absorption coefficients a1, a2,... respectively, then the total absorptive power of the walls may be written as
a = ?ardsr .
r?1

The total rate of absorption by the wall is  Eva .

     Now suppose that the source starts operating at time t = 0 so that at t = 0, E = 0. With this initial condition, we obtain

Solving this equation, we get

     Eqns. (10.7) and (10.8) show that, when the source is removed, the energy density does not go to zero immediately, but falls exponentially.
     Time of reverberation: We take in Eqn. (10.7) the initial steady value of the energy density Emax = 106E, where E is the energy density at the threshold audibility. If T is the time of reverberation, we have
E = 106E expjj?  avT 7j

     Eqn. (10.10) is nothing but Sabine's law of time of reverberation. Note that a has the dimension of (length)2.
When v = 1100 ft/s, K = 0.05 When v = 344 m s-1, K = 0.16.
2. Derive the expression of the time of reverberation in a 'dead room'.
Solution
     In a 'dead room' the absorption coefficient of the material of the walls of the room is large (greater than 0.4) so that the increase in loudness of sound due to reverberation is very small. In this case higher order reflections should be taken into consideration. If a is the mean absorption coefficient of the materials of the walls, everytime the wave strikes the wall, a fraction a of its energy is absorbed and (1 - a ) fraction is reflected. Thus, after removing the source of sound, the intensity falls to I = I0 (1 - a )n after n successive reflections, where I0 is the initial intensity. If I0 = 106I, where I is the threshold audibility, then we have
I = 10-6 = (1 - a )n
I0
or	n = ?	?6	 ? ??6 ? 2.303 .

log10 (1 ? a)	ln(1 ? a)
     If l is the average distance traversed by the wave between successive reflections on the walls, then nl = vT, where v is the velocity of the sound wave and T is the reverberation time. We also have l = 4V/S where V = total volume and S = total surface area.
Thus, we have

l = 4V S

= vT n

or	T =  4nV ? 4V ? (?6) ? 2.303
	
vS	vS	ln(1 ? a)

or	T =  ? ?55.27V 

vS ln(1 ? a)


...(10.11)

which is known as Eyring's formula.

     Note: When a is small, ln (1 - a ) = - a and S a = a = total absorption power of the walls, Eqn. (10.11) reduces to
T =  55.27V
va
which is same as Sabine's law [Eqn. (10.9)].
     3. In an auditorium a source of sound of power P1 is switched on. After sufficiently long time, the source is switched off and the time t1 during which the energy density falls to threshold audibility is noted. The same experiment is performed with a different source of


power P2 and the corresponding time t2 is noted. Show that the average absorption coefficient

a of the materials of the walls is given by
a =
vS(t1 ? t2 )
where V = Volume of the auditorium
S = Surface area of the walls of the auditorium v = Velocity of sound in air.
Solution
If E is the energy density of the threshold audibility, then from Eqn. (10.7), we have
E = 4 P1 expJj? avt1 7j ? 4 P2 expJj? avt2 7j
av	H 4V J	av	H 4V J
or	P1	= expr av (t ? t )y

or	a =  4V ln(P1 P2 ).



Since a = a S, we have

v(t1 ? t2 )

a =  4V ln(P1 P2 ) .

     4. Average absorption coefficient of a room of height 15 ft, breadth 20 ft and length 30 ft, is 0.2. Find the reverberation time of the room.
Solution
Volume of the room = V = 15 × 20 × 30 = 9000 cu. ft.
Surface area of the room = 2 × [15 × 20 + 15 × 30 + 20 × 30] = 2700 sq. ft. From Eqn. (10.10), we have

T = 0.05V

     5. A hall has a volume of 2000 m3. Its total absorption is equivalent to 90 m2 of open window. What will be the effect on the reverberation time if an audience fills the hall and thereby increases the absorption by another 90 m2?
Solution

T = 0.16V
a

= 0.16 ? 2000 ? 3.56 s.
90

     When  the  hall  is  filled  with  the  audience,  the  total  absorption  a?  becomes 90 + 90 = 180 m2 of open window. The new reverberation time T ? is
T ? = 0.16 ? 2000 ? T ? 1.72 s.

     6. A studio measuring 20 m × 12 m × 8 m, has a reverberation time of 1.0 s when empty. What will be the reverberation time when an audience of 200 are present inside the studio? Assume that each person is equivalent to 0.4 m2 of absorption.
Solution
Total absorption power of the empty studio is
a =  0.16V ? 0.16 ? 20 ? 12 ? 8 ? 307.2 units.
	
T	1.0 
     Due to presence of the audience, the value of a increases by 200 × 0.4 = 80 m2. Thus, the new reverberation time is
T ? = 0.16V ? 0.79 s.
387.2
     7. An auditorium is 20 ft high, 50 ft wide and 100 ft long and contains 500 wooden seats. Each seat has total absorption power 0.2 unit. The walls, floor and ceiling have an average absorption coefficient 0.03. What is the reverberation time when the auditorium is empty?
Solution
Volume of the auditorium = V = 20 × 50 × 100 = 105 cu. ft. Total surface area of the walls, ceiling and floor
= 2 × (20 × 50 + 20 × 100 + 50 × 100) = 16000 sq. ft.
Absorption units for the walls, ceiling and floor = 0.03 × 16000 = 480 units. Absorption units for the empty wooden seats = 0.2 × 500 = 100 units
Total absorption power = a = 580 units.

Reverberation time = T = 0.05V
a


? 8.62 s.

     8. In problem 7, how much acoustic material of absorption coefficient 0.4 must be placed in the room so that the reverberation time becomes 2 s when the room is empty?
Solution
When T = 2 s, the value of a is

0.05V T

= 0.05 ? 105 ? 2500 units.
2

Thus, the acoustic material of 2500 - 580 = 1920 units of absorption is required. The
area of the required acoustic material S = 1920 = 4800 sq. ft.

     9. In problem 7 what would be the reverberation time when the auditorium is full? Assume that each person has total absorption power 4.7 units.
Solution
Total absorption units of 500 persons = 500 × 4.7 = 2350 units Hence, the total absorption power of full auditorium
= a = 2350 + 580 = 2930 Sabin.

Reverberation time =  0.05V

     10. It is found that one source of sound is 20 dB louder than another source. What is the ratio of their intensities?
Solution
     We have, 10 log (I1/I0) - 10 log (I2/I0) = 20 or	log (I1/I2) = 2
or	I1/I2 = 102 = 100.
     The intensity of sound coming from the first source is 100 times greater than that of the second one.
     11. The sound level in a classroom is 50 dB. How much is the intensity of sound wave (W/m2) in that classroom? What is the corresponding value of energy density of sound wave in the room?
[Velocity of sound in air = 330 m s-1]
Solution
We know,	? = 10 log (I1/I0) = 50
or	I1 = I0 × 105 = 10-12 × 105 = 10-7 W/m2.
From Eqn. (10.1) we have for the energy density
E =   4I ? 4 ? 10?7 ? 1.2 ? 10?9 J/m3.

     12. Spherical sound waves are produced uniformly in all directions from a point source, the radiated power P being 40 W. What is the intensity of the sound waves at a distance 2 m from the source. What is the corresponding sound level?
Solution
All the radiated power must pass through a sphere of radius r centered at the source.
Hence,
P	40

I =  4?r2 ? 4? ? 4 ? 0.80

The corresponding value of the sound level ? is
? = 10 log (I/I ) = 10 log Jj 0.80 7j = 119 dB.
0	H10?12 J
     Note: This value is very close to the threshold of pain (120 dB) of sound level for the human beings.
     13. An office room of si/e 10 ft high, 20 ft wide and 30 ft long has walls made of plaster, wood and glass with mean absorption coefficient 0.03. The floor is covered with a carpet of absorption coefficient 0.15 and the ceiling with acoustic plaster of absorption coefficient 0.40. What is the reverberation time if five persons are present in the room? Each person has total absorption power of 4.6 Sabin. If four persons are typing on four type writers, each producing 1 erg of sound per second, what will be the intensity level in the room after sufficiently long time?

Solution
Volume of the room = V = 10 × 20 × 30 = 6000 cu. ft.
Absorption units for four walls = 0.03 × 1000 = 30 units. Absorption units for the floor = 0.15 × 600 = 90 units Absorption units for the ceiling = 0.40 × 600 = 240 units
Absorption units for 5 persons = 4.6 × 5 = 23 units Total absorption power = a = 383 units.
Hence, reverberation time =  0.05V ? 0.05 ? 6000 = 0.78 s.

E  = Electric field intensity in V/m

H = Magnetic field intensity in A/m
?	= Free charge density in C/m3
J  = Current density in A/m2.

11.2 PROPAGATION OF PLANE ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES IN MATTER
For propagation of plane electromagnetic waves in homogeneous, isotropic, linear and stationary media, the following relations hold:


		
D =  Ke?0 E ? ? E B = Km?0 H ? ? H

...(11.5)
...(11.6)



J  = ? E	(11.7)
Here,
?	= Permittivity of the medium
?  = Magnetic permeability of the medium
?0  = Permittivity constant = 8.85 × 10-12 C2/N.m2 or F/m
?0 = Permeability constant
   = 4? × 10-7 H/m or T.m/A = 1.26 ×10-6 H/m or T.m/A Ke = Dielectric constant or relative permittivity = ?/?0 Km = Relative permeability = ?/?0
?  = Conductivity of the medium in mho/m or A/V.m.

     The electromagnetic waves are transverse in nature and the electric vector E  and the
		
magnetic vector H are always mutually perpendicular. These vectors E and H are so oriented
that their vector product E × H points in the direction of propagation of the electromagnetic wave. In non-conductors (? = 0), the phase velocity of the electromagnetic wave is
u =	c
(Ke Km )1/2 
[c is the velocity of light in free space = 3 × 108 m s-1]
     In non-magnetic media (Km = 1), the index of refraction n is related to the dielectric coefficient by the relation
n = Ke1/2	...(11.8)
     In non-conductors, the vectors E and H are in phase, and the electric and magnetic energy densities are equal:

11.4 RADIATION PRESSURE
Electromagnetic radiation falling on a surface exerts a pressure on it. The average force on a unit area of a plane mirror due to radiation falling normally on it in free space or the radiation pressure is given by



p =  2S ? 1.77 ? 10?11 E2

N m2

...(11.13)



c	rms
     We can ascribe this pressure to a change in momentum 2S/c per unit time and per unit area in the incident wave, the factor 2 being required because the wave is reflected with a momentum equal to its initial momentum but of opposite sign. The factor 2 will not be required if the radiation falls on a perfect absorber.

11.5 POLARIZATION OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE
The transverse electromagnetic wave is said to be polarized (more specifically, plane polari/ed) if the electric field vectors are parallel to a particular direction for all points in the wave. The direction of the electric field vector E is called the direction of polari/ation; the plane containing E and the direction of propagation is called the plane of vibration.
     In a sheet of polarizing material called polaroid, there exists a certain characteristic polarizing direction. The sheet will transmit only those wave train components whose electric vectors vibrate parallel to the polarizing direction and will absorb those that vibrate at right angles to this direction. The intensity of polarized light passing through a sheet of polaroid is reduced from I0 to I where
                              I = I0 cos2 ? (Law of Malus)	...(11.14)
     Here, ? is the angle between the plane of vibration and the polarizing direction of the sheet.
     We consider the case of plane waves travelling in the /-direction. If Ex is different from zero, but Ey is equal to zero for all / and t, the waves are said to be plane polarized along x-direction. We can also have any combination of Ex and Ey (in the case of a single frequency)
with an arbitrary relative phase between Ex and Ey. Then we have a general state of polarization called elliptical polari/ation [See chapter 2].


     1. Set up Maxwell's electromagnetic field equation in differential forms and explain the physical significance of each.
Solution
I. First Equation
Gauss' law for a distribution of changes of volume V in a dielectric medium is given by


	
D. ds
s

=	? dV
V

where ? is the volume charge density and V is the volume enclosed by the closed surface S.


Using the divergence theorem, we have



D ? ds  =
s


 
?? D dV
V

Thus,


 
(?? D ? ?) dV  = 0
V

which is true for any arbitrary small volume dV.
Thus,	V ? D = ?
It is just the differential form of Gauss's law in electrostatics.
II. Second Equation
     Gauss's theorem for magnetostatics states that the total flux of magnetic induction through any closed surface is zero. i.e.,

B ? ds  = 0
s
Using divergence theorem, we get


 
?. B
V

dV = 0

It is true for any arbitrary volume V.
Thus	?. B = 0
     It is just the differential form of Gauss' law in magnetostatics. It also signifies the non existence of magnetic monopoles.

where ? is the magnetic flux linked with the closed surface. The negative sign indicates that the induced emf opposes the change in flux.

Thus,

     The vanishing of the integral for any arbitrary closed surface requires that the integrand itself is zero.

It is just the differential form of Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction.
IV. Fourth Equation
The differential form of Ampere's Circuital law is
?? H  =  J

where J is the conduction current density in A/m2.
Since the divergence of any curl of a vector is zero, we have
?? e? ? H j = ?? J = 0
This is true only when the charge density ? is a constant or, the electric field is steady.
When the charge density changes with time it satisfies the equation of continuity
? ? J	+ ??? = 0

     Thus in general the equation ?? J = 0	is not in conformity with the equation of continuity. To resolve this problem Maxwell introduced the concept of displacement current.
We know from Gauss's law for electricity
?? D  = ?
From equation of continuity we have
??   		 F??D I
?. J ? ?t (?. D) ? ?. J ? ?. GH ?t JK
F	??D I

If we add ??D	?

?? GH

?t JK

F J ? ??D I is zero. Thus,

to J
?t

then the divergence of total current density GH

?t JK

we have the generalised Ampere's law

? ? H	=  J ? ??D
?t
which is known as Ampere-Maxwell law. It incorporates the equation of continuity. The

quantity ??D introduced by Maxwell is called the displacement current density . When
?t
the electric field does not change with time, the displacement current is zero and Ampere's circuital law is applicable.


     2. Show that the displacement current in the dielectric of a parallel-plate capacitor is equal to the conduction current in the connecting leads.
Solution
The capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor is given by
C = ?? A d
where A is the area of the plate and d is the plate separation.
     At any instant if V is the voltage across the capacitor then the charge on the plate of the capacitor is
q = CV
Now, the electric field in the dielectric is (neglecting the fringe effect)
E =  V .

We also have

     (b) Find the frequency at which the conduction current density and displacement current density are equal in magnitude in distilled water where ? = 2.0 × 10-4 mho/m and Ke = 80.
Solution
(a) The conduction current density is given by

Solution
We consider the case of plane waves travelling in the /-direction (along


k? , the direction

of propagation of the wave) so that the wave fronts are planes parallel to the sy-plane. If the vibrations are to be represented by variations of E and H , we see that in any wavefront they must be constant over the whole plane at any instant, and their partial derivatives with respect to s and y must vanish. None of the components of E and H depends on either of the transverse coordinates s and y. Now,
E ? i?Es (/, t) ? ?jEy (/, t) ? k?E/ (/, t)
H ? i?H s (/, t) ? ?jH y (/, t) ? k?H / (/, t).
Then,	?. E ? ??E/ ? 0
?/
which says that E/ is independent of /. That E/ is also independent of t can be seen by considering Maxwell's Eqn. (11.4) in free space:

?? H ? ?0 ??E .
?t
We take the /-component of this equation:
?  ?E/ ? ?H y ? ?H s ? 0
0  ?t	?s	?y
Thus, E/ is a constant. For simplicity, we take this constant to be zero. Similarly, we can show that H/ is a constant and we again take H/ to be zero. Thus, we conclude that apart from the nonwave like constant fields, the electromagnetic plane waves are transverse waves.
Thus, the electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to the direction of propagation k
(/-direction):

E ? i Es (/, t) ? jEy (/, t)

H ? i Hs (/, t) ? jHy (/, t)
and	E ? k? ? 0, H.k? ? 0, E ? H ? (Es Hy ? Ey Hs )k?.
     (i) We take the s-component of Maxwell's equation (11.3) and the y-component of Maxwell's equation (11.4):

Solution
We have E ? i?Es (/, t), Ey ? 0 and E/ = 0. Then from Eqns. (11.17) and (11.18), we get

Hs = 0. We also have H/ = 0, and the magnetic field H is given by
H ? ?j H y (/, t).



find


 	 
Thus, (i) E . H = 0 and (ii) E × H is along

Determine (i) the speed, frequency, wavelength, period, initial phase and E -field amplitude

and polari/ation, (ii) the magnetic field B .
Solution
(i) The wavefunction has the form
Es(/, t) =  Es0  sin k(/ - vt).
Here,	Es = 102 sin [3 × 106?(/ - 3 × 108t)]. We see that k = 3 × 106 ? m-1 and v = 3 × 108 m s-1.

Hence,	=  2?

amplitude is Es0 = 102 Vm-1. The wave is linearly polarized in the s-direction and propagates along the /-axis.

    (ii) The wave is propagating in the /-direction whereas the electric field E oscillates along the s-axis, i.e., the field E resides in the s/-plane. Now, B is normal to both E and
the /-axis, so it resides in the y/-plane. Thus, Bs = 0, B/ = 0 and B = ?j By (/, t). Since,
E = cB, we see that
By (/, t) ? 0.33 ? 10?6 sin ?(3 ? 106 / ? 9 ? 1014 t) T.

     In vacuum ? = ? = 0 and ? = ?0, ? = ?0. Then Eqns. (11.26) and (11.27) reduce to free space wave Eqns. (11.15) and (11.16).
    10. Consider a plane electromagnetic wave travelling along the /-asis in a homogeneous, isotropic, linear and stationary medium. Show that both E and H are transverse.
Solution
     We consider a plane wave propagating in the positive direction along the /-axis such that all derivatives with respect to s and y are zero. From Maxwell's equation (11.1), we have
?. E  =  ??  E/ ? ? ?	...(11.28)

The /-component of this equation gives

?t2

?t	= 0	...(11.29)

Thus, the longitudinal component E/ of the electric field, if it exists, must be of the form
E/ = a + be-?t/?


where a and b are constants. Thus E/ must decrease exponentially with time and we may set E/ = 0. Since we are concerned solely with wave propagation, we may put ? = 0 as obtained from Eqn. (11.28). The wave has no longitudinal component of E .
     It is easy to show that the H vector is also transverse. The divergence of E being equal to zero, we must have ?H/  = 0 because the derivatives with respect to s and y are both zero.
?/

Since H/ is not a function of /, we may set H/ = 0 for propagation of waves. Thus H vector is also transverse.
    11. Consider the propagation of a plane electromagnetic wave along the /-asis in a homogeneous, isotropic, linear and stationary medium. Show that if E is along the s-asis, then H is along the y-asis and the vector product E × H points in the direction of propagation.

Since both E and H are transverse, we can write

     Any wave of angular frequency ? propagating in the positive direction of the /-axis must involve the exponential function

When Ey = 0, Hs = 0. If E is along the s-axis, then H is along the y-axis and E × H

     The integral on the right-hand side is the sum of the electric and magnetic energies. The right-hand side is the energy lost per unit time by the volume V, and the left-hand side must be the total outward flux of energy in Watts over the surface A bounding the volume
V. Thus, when integrated over a closed surface the normal component of the Poynting vector gives the total outward flow of the energy per unit time. This is known as Poynting's Theorem.

20. Derive the Malus law [Eqn. 11.14].

     Let an incident plane-polarized wave E = E0 sin (?t + ?) make an angle ? with the transmission axis. Decomposing the field E into two plane-polarized waves, we obtain.
E1 ? (E0 cos?) sin(?t ? ?), E1 ? (E0 sin?) sin(?t ? ?).

     21. Polari/ed light of initial intensity I0 passes through two analy/ers-the first with its asis at 45° to the amplitude of the initial beam and the second with its asis at 90° to the initial amplitude. What is the intensity of the light that emerges from this system and what is the direction of its amplitude?
Solution

     The angle between the axis of the first analyzer and the initial amplitude A0 is 45°, hence the intensity I? after passing through the first analyzer is equal to I0 cos2 45° = 0.5 I0.
The transmitted amplitude A? is at an angle 45° with respect to the axis of the second analyzer, so the final intensity I = I? cos2 45° = 0.5 × 0.5 I0 = 0.25 I0. Also, the final
amplitude A is at 90° with respect to initial amplitude A0 .
Note that if only the second analyzer were in place, no light would pass through, since

A0 is normal to its transmission axis.
     22. Two polari/ing sheets have their polari/ing direction parallel so that the intensity I0 of the transmitted light is a masimum. Through what angle must either sheet be rotated if the intensity is to drop by one-fourth?

The phenomenon of interference is due to superposition of two wave trains with a constant phase difference between them.

12.1 YOUNG'S EXPERIMENT
Sunlight is allowed to pass through a pin hole S and then through two pin holes S1 and S2
(Fig. 12.1). The pin holes S1 and S2 act as point sources. According to Huygens' principle,
secondary waves are emitted from S1 and S2 and they are superimposed at the screen with a  phase  difference  to  produce  interference  fringes.  Fringes  are  easily  observed  if
monochromatic light is used and the pin holes are replaced by parallel slits. The distance between any two consecutive bright or dark fringes is the fringe width (?),

? =  ??D
d
where	? = wavelength of the monochromatic light
d = the separation between the coherent sources S1 and S2
and	D = distance of the screen from the coherent sources (S1S2).


...(12.1)

     It may be noted that interference (constructive or destructive) can occur only between overlapping waves from coherent sources. Further, two sources S1 and S2 are coherent provided there is a fixed difference between the phases of the wave emitted by S1 at S1 and the wave from S2 at S2.

12.2 DISPLACEMENT OF FRINGES DUE TO INTERPOSITION OF THIN FILM
If a thin strip of a transparent body of uniform thickness t is introduced in the path of one of the light rays coming from S1 and S2, the optical path of that beam is changed and the central fringe is shifted through a distance x. Then,

t =   x?	
(n ? 1)?
where n is the refractive index of the transparent body.


...(12.2)


12.3 FRESNEL'S BIPRISM
Two virtual sources S1 and S2 are produced by using Fresnel's biprism. The distance d between the virtual sources is usually measured by the displacement method. A convex lens is placed between the biprism and the eyepiece. The eyepiece is fixed at a distance from the slit which is greater than four times the focal length of the lens. For two positions of the lens, distinct images of S1 and S2 are formed in the plane of the cross wires of the eyepiece. If the
separation between the images of S1 and S2 at the two positions of the lens are d1 and d2, then
d =	d1d2	(12.3)

12.4 CHANGE OF PHASE DUE TO REFLECTION
A phase change of ? occurs when a ray of light is reflected from the surface of an optically denser medium on to a rarer medium.

12.5 LLYOD'S MIRROR
The interference fringes are formed by two narrow pencils of light, one proceeding directly from the source and the other being reflected by a mirror. In this case, the reflected ray suffers a phase change of ? and the first fringe close to the mirror is dark.

12.6 THIN-FILM INTERFERENCE
When light falls on a thin transparent film, the light waves reflected from the upper and the lower surfaces of the film produce an interference pattern.

12.7 THE MICHELSON INTERFEROMETER
In Michelson interferometer, a light beam is split into two sub-beams which after traversing different optical paths are recombined to form an interference fringe pattern. By varying the path length of one of the sub-beams, the distances can be measured accurately in terms of wavelengths of light.


     1. Obtain the conditions for maximum and minimum intensity of light in Young's double slit experiment. Find the average intensity of the interference pattern and show that it is exactly that which would exist in the absence of interference.
Solution
     Monochromatic light of wavelength ? is allowed to pass through a slit S and then at a considerable distance away, through two parallel slits S1 and S2 (Fig. 12.1).





Fig. 12.1
     The slits S1 and S2 are equidistant from S so that S1 and S2 act as coherent sources in the same phase; if they are of same width, they will emit disturbances of equal amplitudes. These disturbances are superimposed at P on the screen with a phase difference
? =  2? (S2 P ? S1 P) ?  2? ?
?	?
where ? = S2P - S1P is the path difference. If y1 and y2 are displacements at P due to the waves coming from S1 and S2, we have
y1 = a sin ?t
y2 = a sin (?t + ?)
where a is the amplitude of both the waves. According to the principle of superposition, the resultant displacement y is
y = y1 + y2 = A sin (?t + ?)
where	A cos ? = a (? + cos ?)
A sin ? = a sin ?
and A is the amplitude of the resultant displacement. Thus,
A2 = 4a2 cos2 FG?? IJ .
The intensity I of the light at P is proportional to the square of the resultant amplitude.
I ? A2 = 4a2 cos2 FG?? IJ	(12.4a)

Thus, we have


I = 4I0cos2 FG?? IJ	...(12.4b)

where I0 is the intensity on the screen associated with light from one of the two slits, the other slit being temporarily covered. For maximum intensity, ? = 0, 2?, 4?,... or, path difference
? = 0, ?, 2?... ; and for minimum intensity ? = ?, 3?, 5?,... or, ? = ?? ,  3? ,  5? , ...
2  2	2


     The point P0 on the screen is equidistant from S1 and S2. At P0, ? = 0 and ? = 0. We have maximum intensity at P0. From S1 we drop a perpendicular S1Q on S2P and suppose
<S S Q = ?, then ? = d sin ? and ? =  2? d sin ?, where d = S S = separation between the
2 1	?	1  2
coherent sources. Thus, the conditions for maxima and minima are
maxima	d sin ? ? m?, m = 0, +1, +2,.	(12.5a)


minima	d sin ? =

FGm ? 1IJ ?, m = 0, +1, +2,.	(12.5b)

L	1 F	 d I2	2 y
and	S2P   ?   D MN1 ? 2 GHx ?  2 JK	D  PQ

The path difference ? becomes


? = S P - S P = xd = d tan ? ? d sin ?



where ? POP0

dark fringes	x =

FGm ? 1IJ ??D , m = 0, +1, +2,.	(12.6b)

H	2K d
At P0, m = 0, i.e., zeroth order bright fringe is formed at P0.
     The distance between any two consecutive bright or dark fringes is known as fringe width and it is given by
? = (m + 1) ??D ? m ??D ? ??D .
d	d	d
     Thus, alternately dark and bright parallel fringes are formed on both sides of P0. The width of the bright fringe is equal to the width of the dark fringe.


     The intensity at P is given by Eqn. (12.4a). Since the amplitude a decreases with the increasing distance S1P, the intensity decreases with increasing x, and the intensity decreases with increasing D.
     The intensity at bright points is 4I0 and at dark point it is zero. Here, the energy is transferred from the points of minimum intensity to the points of maximum intensity. The average value of cos2 (?/2) is 1/2. Therefore, the average intensity of the interference pattern is < I > = 2I0. Now, with two independent sources, each beam acts separately and contributes I0 and so without interference we would have a uniform intensity of 2I0.
     2. Two straight narrow slits 0.25 mm apart are illuminated by a monochromatic source of wavelength 589 nm. Fringes are obtained at a distance of 50 cm from the slit. Find the width of the fringes.

E1 = E0 sin ?t
E2 = E0 sin (?t + 15°) E3 = E0 sin (?t + 30°) E4 = E0 sin (?t + 45°)
Solution
     E (t) = E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 = A sin (?t + ?) say. Equating the coefficients of sin ?t and cos ?t from both sides we get
A cos ? = E0(1 + cos 15° + cos 30° + cos 45°) = 3.539E0
A sin ? = E0(sin 15° + sin 30° + sin 45°) = 1.4659E0
which give	A = 3.83E0 and ? = 22.5°
Thus,	E(t) = 3.83E0 sin (?t + 22.5°).
     5. What is the phase difference between the waves from the two slits at the mth dark fringe in a Young's double-slit experiment?

Solution
     For mth order bright fringe we have d sin ? = m?. Now since ? is very small, sin ? ? ? = m?/d.
(a) ? = 3 ? 600 ? 10?9 = 3 × 10-4 radian

     7. A double-slit arrangement produces interference fringes for sodium light (? = 589 nm) that are 0.004 rad apart. For what wavelength would the angular separation be 10% greater?

Solution
Angular separation of the interference fringe = ?? =

Thus,	d =  589 ? 10?9

m = 14725 × 10-8 m

New angular separation =  110
100


× 0.004 rad = 0.0044 rad

The required wavelength = 0.0044 × 14725 × 10-8 m
= 647.9 nm.
     8. In a double-slit experiment ? = 546 nm, d = 0.10 mm and D = 20 cm. What is the linear distance between the fifth maximum and seventh minimum from the central maximum?
Solution
Linear distance of the fifth maximum from the central maximum = x1 = 5? D/d.

Linear distance of the seventh minimum from the central maximum = x2

= d6 ?  1 i ?D/d.

Thus, the required linear distance = x2 - x1 = 1.638 mm.

     11. In a double-slit experiment, the slits are 2 mm apart and are illuminated with a mixture of two wavelengths, ? = 750 nm and ?? = 900 nm. At what minimum distance from the common central bright fringe on a screen 2 m from the slits will a bright fringe from one interference pattern coincide with a bright fringe from the other?
Solution
     From Eqn. (12.6a) we see that the mth bright fringe of the ?-pattern and the m-th bright fringe of the ?? pattern are located at

     13. In Fresnel's biprism experiment show that the distance d between the two virtual sources S1 and S2 produced by it is given by
d = 2l (n - 1)?
where l  = distance between the slit and the biprism
n = refractive index of the material of the prism
? = refracting angle of the biprism.
Solution
     The biprism ABC is highly obtuse (i.e., angle B is 178° and the refracting angles A
and C are very small (Fig. 12.3). When light	 falls from the source S on the upper portion
of the biprism it is bent downwards and appears to come from the virtual source S1. Similarly when light falls on the lower portion

of the biprism it is bent upwards and appears to come from the virtual source S2. Thus, S1

Fig. 12.3

and S2 act as two coherent sources distant d apart. The conditions for bright and dark fringes on the screen are given by Eqns. (12.5) and (12.6) of Young's double slit experiment.

     Since each of the constituent prisms of the biprism is thin, the deviation produced in a ray is given by
? = (n - 1)?
where n is the refractive index of the material of the prism. Since d = S1S2 is small, we may write
? =	= (n - 1) ?.
Thus, we have	d = 2l (n ? 1) ??	...(12.7)

     15. In an experiment with a biprism the distance between the focal plane of the eyepiece and the plane of the interfering sources is 100 cm. A lens inserted between the biprism and the eyepiece gives two images of the slit in two positions. In one case the two images of slit are 0.3 mm and in the other are 1.2 mm apart. If sodium light (? = 589.3 nm) is used find the distance between the interfering bands.
Solution
Here,	d =	0.3 ? 1.2 mm = 0.6 mm

     16. When a thin strip of a transparent body of uniform thickness t is introduced at right angles to the path of one of the light rays coming from two slits of Young's experiment, the central fringe on the screen is found to be shifted through a distance x. Show that
t =   x?	
(n ? 1)?
where ? = Wavelength of the monochromatic light used n = Refractive index of the transparent body
? = Fringe width.

Solution
     S1 and S2 are two coherent monochromatic sources. The	S1 disturbances emitted by them are superimposed on the screen P0P0? to produce interference fringes (Fig. 12.4). P0 is the position of the central band. If a thin transparent film of	S uniform thickness t is introduced in the path of one of the
light rays the optical path of that ray changes and the


t

position of the central fringe will be displaced. After the introduction of the transparent strip of thickness t (refractive index n) at right angles to the beam S1P0? the central fringe is displaced to P?0 from P0 on the screen. Thus the optical path difference between the rays = S2P0? -(S1P0?- t) - nt = 0 which gives
S2P0? - S1P0? = (n - 1)t.

     20. (a) A ray of light travelling through the medium I is incident on the surface of separation of two media I and II of which the medium II is optically denser (Fig. 12.6). This light is partly reflected on to the rarer medium and partly transmitted into the denser medium.
By reversing the reflected and the transmitted rays show that
r? = - r
where r = amplitude reflection coefficient in the rarer medium I and r? = amplitude reflection coefficient in the denser medium.
(b) Comment on the change of phase due to reflection of light.
Solution
     (a) Stoke's treatment: Suppose PQ represents the separation surface of two media I and II of which the medium II is optically denser. A ray of light AO is incident on PQ. This light is partly reflected along OB and partly transmitted along OC. Suppose a is the amplitude of the incident light wave, r is the amplitude reflection coefficient in the rarer medium I and t is the amplitude transmission coefficient from the rarer medium I to the denser medium
II. The amplitude of the reflected ray OB is ar and that of the transmitted ray OC is at. If there is no absorption in the medium, we have
r + t = 1
Now if the reflected and transmitted rays are reversed they should recombine along OA to give the original amplitude a.

P	Q







Fig. 12.6


     If OB is reversed, the part of the amplitude reflected along OA is arr = ar2 and that transmitted along OD is art. If OC is reversed, the part reflected along OD is atr? and transmitted along OA is att? where r? is the reflection coefficient in the denser medium II and t? is the transmission coefficient from denser to the rarer medium. Since the two amplitudes along OA combine together to give the original amplitude a, we have
                       ar2 + att? = a, or, r2 + tt? = 1 The total amplitude along OD is zero, i.e.,
art + atr? = 0
or	r? = -r.
     The negative sign indicates that one of the rays has a positive displacement and the other has a negative displacement.
     (b) The coefficient r represents the reflection from a denser medium on to a rarer medium and the coefficient r? represents the reflection from a rarer medium on to a denser medium. The two rays differ in phase by ?. Actually in some experiments (e.g., Newton's rings and Lloyd's mirror experiments) a phase change of ? is noticed in the former case (reflection from a denser on to a rarer medium). No change of phase is found to occur in the latter case. When reflection occurs from an interface beyond which the medium has a higher refractive index, the reflected wave undergoes a phase change of ?; when the medium beyond the interface has a lower refractive index, there is no change of phase. The transmitted wave undergoes no change of phase in either case.
     21. Interference fringes are produced by two pencils of light one proceeding directly from the source S1 and the other being reflected from a mirror MM? (Fig. 12.7). Find the conditions for maximum and minimum brightness of fringes on the screen AB. (This arrangement for obtaining a double-slit interference pattern from a single slit is called Lloyd's mirror.)

22. Find the condition of formation of bright and dark fringes due to thin film interference.
Solution
     Light coming from the same source is reflected from the upper and lower surfaces of the plane-parallel film many times. These reflected rays originate from the same source. They are coherent and are in a position to interfere. The set of transmitted light rays obtained are also in a position to interfere.
(a) Interference due to reflected rays
     Let us calculate the path difference between any two reflected rays. A ray of light from the source S is incident at A (Fig. 12.8) on the upper surface of a thin film of thickness d and of refractive index n.

Fig. 12.8
     A part of this ray will be reflected along AR1 and a part refracted in the direction AF. After reaching the point F on the lower surface of the film, the ray AF is partly reflected towards B and partly refracted towards FH. At B the ray FB will again be divided into two parts-a part reflected in the direction BC and the other part transmitted in air along BR2. The ray BC is partly reflected and partly transmitted at the lower surface of the film. CG is the transmitted ray.
     We consider the two successive reflected rays AR1 and BR2. They are derived from the same source S and are in a position to interfere when they are brought together. Since the film is parallel sided, AR1 and BR2 will also be parallel to each other. A perpendicular BN is dropped from B on AR1. Then the plane passing through BN and perpendicular to the plane of the paper is the new wavefront. The path difference between the rays AR1 and BR2 is
? = n (AF + FB) - AN

where we have used n = sin i/sin r. It should be noted that the two rays are reflected under different conditions. The first ray AR1 is reflected from the optically denser medium, and the second ray AFB is reflected from the rarer medium. The first ray undergoes a phase change of ? and no change of phase occurs in the second ray. Thus, an extra change of ?, or, a path difference of ?/2 is introduced in ?. Hence the correct result is
? = 2nd cos r +?/2	(12.8)
     The conditions for the formation of bright and dark fringes due to interference in the reflected rays are:

2nd cos r + ??

2nd cos r + ?? = Jjm ? 17j ?	(minima)

These may be rewritten as
2nd cos r = Jjm ? 17j ? (maxima)	...(12.9a)
H	2J
2nd cos r = m? (minima)	...(12.9b)
with m = 0, 1, 2, 3,....
For near normal incidence (r ? 0°), we have


2nd =

Jjm ? 17j? (maxima)	...(12.10a)

H	2J
2nd = m? (minima)	...(12.10b)
with m = 0, 1, 2,...
(b) Interference due to transmitted rays
     Interference phenomenon occurs with the transmitted rays FH and CG. A perpendicular CN? is dropped from C on FH (Fig. 12.8). The path difference between the transmitted rays FH and CG is
? = n(FB + BC) - FN?
= 2n FB - FC sin i

= 2n	d
cos r


- 2d tan r sin i

= 2nd cos r


     In the case of transmitted rays there is only internal reflection at B and this causes no additional change of phase. Thus, for the transmitted rays we have the following conditions for maxima and minima:
maxima	2nd cos r = m?	(12.11a)
minima	2nd cos r = Jjm ? 17j?	(12.11b)



with m = 0, 1, 2,...

H	2J

     These conditions are just opposite to those obtained with the reflected rays. As a result a reflected and transmitted interference patterns are complementary to each other. This means that the position which corresponds to the maximum of the reflected system will be the position of minimum of the transmitted system and vice versa.
     23. A water film (n = 4/3) in air is 315 nm thick. If it is illuminated with white light at normal incidence, what colour will it appear to be in the reflected light?
Solution
For maxima, we have the relation ? =	2nd
2
When  m = 0, ? = 1680 nm (infrared),
m = 1, ? = 560 nm (visible),
m = 2, ? = 336 nm (ultraviolet).
     Only the maximum corresponding to m = 1 lies in the visible region. Light of wavelength 560 nm appears yellow-green. The water film will appear yellow-green in the reflected light.
     24. A lens is coated with a thin film of transparent substance magnesium fluoride (MgF2) with n = 1.38 to reduce the reflection from the glass surface (n = 1.50). How thick a coating is needed to produce a minimum reflection at the centre of the visible spectrum (? = 550 nm)?
Solution
     We assume that the light strikes the lens at near-normal incidence. We would like to find the thickness of the film that will bring about destructive interference between rays R1 and R2 (Fig. 12.9). Phase change of ? is now associated with each ray and the condition of minimum intensity is now

     25. A soap film of thickness 5.5 × 10-5 cm is viewed at an angle of 45°. Its index of refraction is 1.33. Find the wavelengths of light in the visible spectrum which will be absent from the reflected light.
Solution
Since	n =  sin i , cos r = 0.84696,
sin r
where i is the angle of incidence and r is the angle of refraction.
For minima,	2nd cos r = m?
When m = 1, ? = 12.39 × 10-5 cm (infrared)
m = 2, ? = 6.20 × 10-5 cm (visible)
m = 3, ? = 4.13 × 10-5 cm (visible)
m = 4, ? = 3.10 × 10-5 cm (ultra violet)
Hence the absent wavelengths in the reflected light are 6.20 × 10-5  cm and
4.13×10-5 cm in the visible region of spectrum.

(a) If you are looking straight down from an airplane onto a region of the slick where its thickness is 460 nm, for which wavelength(s) of visible light is the reflection the greatest? (b) If you are scuba-diving directly under this same region of the slick, for which wavelength(s) of visible light is the transmitted intensity the strongest.
Solution
(a) For the reflected rays, the condition for maxima is [see problem 24] 2nd = m?,
or	? =  2nd ? 2 ? 1.2 ? 460 nm

The wavelength of visible light (for m = 2) is 552 nm.

     27. A plane wave of monochromatic light falls normally on a uniform thin film of oil that covers a glass plate. The wavelength of the source can be varied continuously. Complete destructive interference of the reflected light is observed for wavelengths of 500 and 700 nm and for no wavelengths between them. If the index of refraction of the oil is 1.3 and that of glass is 1.5, find the thickness of the oil film.
Solution
The condition of destructive interference of the reflected light is (see problem 24)
2nd = (2m + 1)?/2
or	4nd = (2m + 1)?
Thus, 4 × 1.3 × d = 700 (2m + 1) = 500[2(m + 1) + 1]
which gives m = 2 and d = 673.08 nm.
     28. Find the conditions of formation of bright and dark fringes produced by a wedge- shaped thin film for near normal incidence.
Solution

     We consider two plane surfaces OA and OB inclined at an angle ? which is very small (Fig. 12.10). The thickness of the film increases from O to A. When the film is viewed with reflected monochromatic light, a system of equidistant interference fringes are observed which are parallel to the line of intersection of the two surfaces. A parallel beam of monochromatic light falls on the face OB almost normally. The components reflected from the

upper and the lower surfaces will interfere to produce alternatively dark and bright bands. Since the angle of wedge ? is very small, the beam incident normally to the face OB may very well be considered normal to the face OA too. The path difference between the two reflected beams is (2nt + ?/2) at the point P where the thickness of the wedge is t. So at this position of the film there will be dark fringe when
2nt + ?? ? Jjm ? 17j?,	m = 0, 1, 2,....

or	2nt = m? (minima)
where n is the refractive index of the film. For bright fringes, we have
2nt = Jjm ? 17j? (maxima)

We know ? = t/x or t = x? (see Fig. 12.10). Thus mth dark fringe appears at P when
2nx? = m?
Similarly, if (m + p)th dark fringe is formed at a distance x1 from O, we have
2nx1? = (m + p)?
Thus,	2n(x1 - x)? = p?
We can count the number of fringes in a space (x1 - x) with a travelling microscope.
Here x1 - x is the distance corresponding to p fringes. The fringe width ? is given by

     33. Newton's rings: The curved surface of the plano-convex lens of large focal length is placed on an optically flat glass plate. A transparent liquid of refractive index n is placed between the lens and the glass plate so that a thin film is formed between the lens and the glass plate (n being less than the refractive index of the material of the lens or glass plate; the liquid may be air). Interference fringes are produced when monochromatic light is incident on the lens. Find the conditions of formation of bright and dark fringes.
Solution
     Let LOL? be the convex surface of a lens in contact with the plane surface PP? (Fig. 12.11). O is the point of contact. A liquid of refractive index n is placed between the glass plate and the lens. The point where the lens touches the glass plate, the thickness of the film is zero. The thickness of the film increases all around this point as we move away from O. The thin film of liquid thus enclosed is wedge shaped, and the loci of all points having the same thickness are circles. When monochromatic light is made to fall normally on such a film, a series of concentric bright and dark rings are visible all round the point of contact, both in the reflected and in the transmitted

rays.

Fig. 12.11
Let C be a point on PP? at a distance ? from the point of contact. The thickness of the

film at C is CB = t. Thus, the path difference between the two reflected rays at this position is (2nt + ?/2) for normal incidence (see problem 28). So at this position of the film there will
be a dark fringe when

It is found that nth dark ring due to ?1 coincides with (n + 1)th dark ring due to ?2. Show that the radius of the nth dark ring for the wavelength ?1 is given by
?n = [?1?2R/(?1 - ?2)]1/2.
Solution
?n = the radius of the nth dark ring due to ?1

The radius of the (n + 1)th dark ring due to ?2

Thus, we have

     37. Describe the construction of Michelson's interferometer. If the movable mirror of Michelson's interferometer is moved through a small distance d, and the number of fringes that cross the field of view is m, then show that the wavelength of light is given by
? = 2d/m.
Solution
     An instrument that is designed primarily to measure lengths or changes in length with degree of accuracy by means of interference fringes is known as an interferometer. One of the widely used interferometers is the one devised and built by A.A. Michelson.
     The light from the source S falls on a beam splitter F (Fig. 12.13). F and G are two plane-parallel optical flats, which are usually cut from a single parallel plate so that they are identical. The surface of F nearest to G may be half silvered in order that the light falling upon it be 50% reflected and 50% transmitted, although this is not necessary for the operation of the interferometer. The mirror M2 is mounted on a carriage, so that it can be moved along a precision-mechanical track. The motion of M2 is controlled by a very fine micrometer screw. The mirror M1 is held by springs against adjusting screws so that M1 may be made exactly perpendicular to M2,
     Light from the source S is rendered parallel by the lens L. After entering F the light is divided into two parts: one part proceeds to the mirror M1 which returns the light to the eye after reflection at F; the other part, reflecting inside F, proceeds to M2, which reflects


it back through F to E. From a single source, by division of amplitude, two beams are produced and they are recombined for the formation of interference fringes.













S







Fig. 12.13
     The beam going towards the mirror M2 and reflected back, has to pass twice through the glass plate F. Therefore to compensate for the path the plate G is used between the mirror M1 and F. The light beam going towards the mirror M1 and reflected back towards F also passes twice through the compensating plate G. Thus the paths of the two rays in
glass are the same. Suppose the mirrors M1 and M2 are at distances d1 and d2 respectively from the glass plate F. In measuring d1 and d2 we do not consider the paths of the rays in
glass. The path difference for the two waves when they recombine is 2d2 - 2d1 and anything that changes this path difference will cause a change in the relative phase of the two waves

as they enter the eye. If the mirror M2

is moved by a distance 1  , the path difference
2

changes by ? and the observer will see the fringe pattern shift by one fringe. If the mirrors M1 and M2 are exactly perpendicular to each other, the system is essentially equivalent to the interference from an air film whose thickness is equal to d2 - d1. Suppose when the mirror M2 is moved through a distance d, the number of fringes that cross the field of view is m. Then we have
d = m ??
2
or	2d = m?.
     38. Let m1 and m1 + 1 be the changes in the order at the centre of the field of view of Michelson's interferometer when the movable mirror is displaced through a distance d between two consecutive positions of maximum distinctness of the fringes of two neighbouring spectral lines with wavelengths ?1 and ?2 respectively. Show that



where ? is the mean of ?1 and ?2.

Solution
We have



2d = m1?1 = (m1 + 1)?2

which gives	m1

=	?2
?1 ? ?2

and	2d =	?1?2
?1 ? ?2
where ?1 and ?2 are two neighbouring spectral lines, we may write ?1?2 ? ?2, where ? is the mean value of ?1 and ?2.


Thus,	?? = ?1

= ?2 .

     40. After obtaining the fringes in Michelson's interferometer with white light, the white light is replaced by sodium light. When one mirror of the interferometer is now moved through a distance of 0.15 mm the fringes are found to disappear. If the mean wavelength for the two components of the D lines of sodium light is 5893 Å, find the difference between their wavelengths.
Solution
We have	2d = m ? = Jjm1 ? 17j?2 ,

     41. An airtight chamber 5 cm long with glass windows is placed in one arm of a Michelson's interferometer. Light of wavelength ? = 480 nm is used. The air is slowly evacuated from the chamber using a vacuum pump. While the air is being removed 61 fringes are observed to pass through the field of view. Find the index of refraction of air at atmospheric pressure.
Solution
     In Michelson interferometer, light travels twice through the chamber. Thus, we have the formula,

    (b) the minimum value of thickness of the coated film on the face AC for which the light emerging from the face has maximum intensity. [Given the refractive index of the material of

Angle of emergence is zero.
     (b) The reflected ray 1 is reflected from the denser medium (Fig. 12.17). For the reflected ray 1 there is a phase change of ?. There is no change of phase for the second reflected ray 2. Thus the condition of maxima for the reflected rays is [see problem 22].

Solution
     (a) The screen is placed parallel to the mirror AB. The points of equal optical path for direct rays from S will lie on a circle with P as the centre. The points of equal optical path for the reflected rays will also lie on a circle with P as the centre. Therefore the fringes formed will be circular.

Fig. 12.22

(d) of type such that the fringe spacing increases as we go outwards.	(I.I.T. 1999)


Solution
     When a cylinder is placed on a glass plate with its curved surface touching the plane surface, a thin film is formed between the curved surface of the cylinder and the glass plate. The glass plate will touch the slice of the cylinder in a straight line parallel to the axis of the cylinder, and the thickness of the film increases as we move away from this straight line. The loci of all points having the same thickness are straight lines. Thus straight line fringes will appear in this combination. The fringe spacing will decrease as we go outwards.

13.1 DIFFRACTION
When a light wave encounters an obstacle or hole whose size is comparable to its wavelength the light wave spreads out to some extent into the region of the geometrical shadow. This bending of light round an obstacle is an example of diffraction of light. Diffraction is a convincing evidence of the wave theory of light. According to Huygens' principle, the wave is divided at the obstruction into infinitesimal wavelets which interfere with each other as they proceed. We consider diffraction effects that occur at a large distance from the obstruction (Fraunhofer diffraction). Sometimes this effect is studied experimentally by interposing a lens so that patterns that would otherwise occur at infinite distance are focussed onto a screen at the focal plane of the lens.

13.2 SINGLE-SLIT DIFFRACTION
When a beam of parallel rays is incident normally on a long narrow slit of width a, the emergent rays produce single-slit diffraction pattern with a central maximum together with minima corresponding to the diffraction angles ? that satisfy
a sin ? = m?, m = +1, +2, +3,... (minima)
or	? = m? with ? = ??a sin ?.
?
The diffracted intensity for a given diffraction angle ? is
I = Im sin2 ?/?2
where Im is the intensity of the central maximum (? = 0) or the principal maximum.

13.3 DIFFRACTION BY A CIRCULAR APERTURE
Diffraction by a circular aperture or lens with diameter d produces a central maximum with a first minimum at a diffraction angle ?1 given by



When ?1 is small we may write

sin ?1

= 1.22 ??

(first minimum)

?1 ? 1.22?/d.


13.4 RAYLEIGH CRITERION
According to Lord Rayleigh two adjacent spectral lines are just resolved when the principal maximum of one falls on the first minimum of the other. When two objects are viewed through a telescope or microscope they are on the verge of resolvability if the central diffraction maximum of one is at the first minimum of the other. Due to diffraction through a circular aperture their angular separation must be at least
                                   ?R = 1.22?/d where d is the diameter of the objective lens.

13.5 DOUBLE-SLIT DIFFRACTION
A beam of parallel rays passing normally through two slits, each of width a, whose centres are d distance apart, produces diffraction pattern whose intensity I at various diffraction angles ? is given by

13.6 MULTIPLE-SLIT DIFFRACTION

13.7 DIFFRACTION GRATING
A diffraction grating consists of a large number (N) of parallel equidistant slits. The principal maxima are given by
d sin ? = m?, m = 0, +1, +2,...
A grating is characterised by two parameters, the dispersion D and the resolving power R. When a composite pencil of light is incident on a grating the different colours are separated from each other forming the diffraction spectrum. This separation of colours or
wavelengths, known as dispersion, is given by

D = ???
??

=	m	.
d cos ?

The resolving power of a grating is its power of separating two very close spectral lines.
According to Rayleigh's criterion two lines are just resolved in the mth order when
? ?   = Nm.
??


Here ?? is the smallest difference of wavelengths that can be resolved at the wavelength ?.
The quantity ?/?? is called the resolving power R of the grating.

13.8 X-RAY DIFFRACTION
The wavelength of X-rays or thermal neutrons is of the same order as the distances between atoms in a crystal. The regular array of atoms in a crystal is considered to be a three- dimensional diffraction grating for waves of short wavelengths. The atoms can be visualised as being arranged in planes with characteristic interplanar spacing d. Diffraction maxima occur if the incident direction of the wave, measured from the surface of a plane of atoms, satisfies Bragg's law:
2d sin? = m?, m = 1, 2, 3,...
where ? is the wavelength of the radiation, and ? is the angle which the incident beam makes with the lattice plane.



1. Single-slit diffraction: When a monochromatic beam of parallel rays of wavelength
? falls normally on a long narrow slit of width a, the emergent rays produce single-slit diffraction pattern. Show that the diffracted intensity corresponding to the diffraction angle
? is given by
I = Im sin2 ?/?2
where	? = ??a sin ?,
?
and Im is the intensity of the central maximum (? = 0).
Solution
     A beam of parallel rays is incident normally on the single slit of width a (Fig. 13.1). Let ds be an element of the width of the wavefront in the plane of the slit, at a distance s from the centre O of the slit. The secondary waves which travel normal to the slit will be focussed at P0 by the lens L and those which travel at the diffraction angle ? will reach P. The amplitude at P due to the spherical wavelet emitted by the element ds situated at O is directly proportional to the lengths ds and inversely proportional to the distance x. Thus the infinitesimal displacement at P due to this element may be written as


dy0

= B ds sin (?t - kx)
x

where B is the proportionality constant.










P



Po










Fig. 13.1
     As the position of ds is changed the displacement it produces at P will have different phase. When it is at A which is at a distance s below the origin, the contribution will be


dys

=  Bds sin [?t - k(x + ?)].
x

     where ? is the path difference between the corresponding rays coming from O and A. From O a perpendicular OC is dropped on AC.
Now,	? + ?P0OC = ?P0OC + ?COA = 90°.
Thus,	?COA = ? and ? = AC = OA sin ? = s sin ?,


and	dys

=  Bds sin [?t - kx - ks sin ?].
x

We now wish to sum the effects of all elements from s = ? a
2

to a . The contribution
2

from the pair of elements symmetrically placed at s and -s is
dy = dys + dy-s
=  Bds [sin (?t - kx - ks sin ?) + sin (?t - kx + ks sin ?)]
x
=  2Bds sin (?t - kx) cos (ks sin ?)
x
which must be integrated from s = 0 to a .
2
     In doing so we regard x as a constant since the change in amplitude due to small change of x is negligible. Thus the resultant vibration at P is given by

2B
y =	x

a / 2
sin(?t ? kx)	cos(ks sin ?)ds
0



=  2B sin(?t ? kx) sin jj ka sin ?7j


(k sin?).



If we define

x	H 2	j

? ? 1 kasin ? ? ?a sin ?
?


...(13.1)

2	?
then	y ? aB sin(?t ? kx) sin ? ?.
x
Thus the resultant vibration at P will be simple harmonic with amplitude
A = A0 sin ?/?	...(13.2)

where	A0

=  aB .
x

The path difference between the rays coming from two edges of the slit is a sin ? and

the corresponding phase difference is  2?
?

a sin ? = 2?. Thus ? signifies one-half of the phase

difference between the contributions coming from the two edges of the slit.
The intensity on the screen is given by
I ? A2 ? A2 sin2 ? ?2 .
     At the point P0, ? = 0, ? = 0, sin ?/? = 1 and all the secondary wavelets arrive in phase at this point. We get the position of the central maximum or the principal maximum. If Im is the intensity at the central maximum, then we have
I = Im sin2 ?/?2	...(13.3)
     2. Find the positions and intensities of the maxima and the positions of the minima of the single-slit diffraction pattern (problem 1).
Solution
     From Eqn. 13.3 the position of the central maximum or the principal maximum is given by ? = 0 or ? = 0.
Minima: The intensity falls to zero at ? = +?, +2?, +3?,.	or, in general ? = m? with
m = +1, +2,.....So on one side of the diffraction pattern the minima are equispaced.
     Maxima: Between two minima we have secondary maxima. The secondary maxima do not lie half way between the minima points, but are displaced towards the centre of the pattern by an amount which decreases with increasing m. The exact values of ? for these maxima may be found by differentiating Eqn. (13.2) with respect to ? and equating to zero:
 dA ? A r cos? ? sin ? y ? 0

d?	0 jL ?

?2  jQ

or	? = tan ?, ? ? 0	...(13.4)
The solutions of Eqn. (13.4) gives us the secondary maxima points. These points are
? = +1.43?, +2.46?, +3.47?,....
The positions of maxima and minima are given below:
Maxima ? = m?, m = 0, +1.43, +2.46, +3.47,....
Minima  ? = m?, m = +1, +2, +3,....


Since ? = ??a sin ? = m?, we have
?
sin? =   m? or, ? =  m?
a	a
with	m = 0, +1.43, +2.46, +3.47,...	(maxima)
m = +1, +2, +3,...	(minima)
     The angular width of the pattern for a given wavelength is inversely proportional to the slit width a. If the width a is made larger, the pattern shrinks to a small scale. When the width is very large compared to the wavelength of light, the diffraction pattern disappears.
     From Eqn. (13.2) we find that the amplitude A decreases with increasing ? as ? occurs in the denominator. Therefore, the intensity decreases with increasing ? (Fig. 13.2). The width of the central maximum (? ranges form -? to ?) is ?? = 2? while the width of the secondary maximum is ?? = ?. Thus the central maximum is twice as great as that of the fainter secondary maximum.

     The intensities of the secondary maxima may be calculated to a close approximation by finding the values of sin2 ?/?2 at the half way between the minima points, i.e.,

The exact values of the intensities of the secondary maxima are given below:
(i) 1st secondary maximum: ? = + 1.43? and sin2 ?/?2 = 0.0496. Thus the intensity of 1st secondary maximum is 4.96% of the intensity of the central maximum.
(ii) 2nd secondary maximum: ? = + 2.46? and sin2 ?/?2 = 0.0168. The intensity is 1.68% of that of central maximum.
(iii) 3rd secondary maximum: ? = + 3.47? and sin2 ?/?2 = 0.0083. The intensity is only 0.83% of the intensity of the central maximum.
     Linear distance on the screen between successive minima: Suppose for the 1st and 2nd minima, the values of the angle ? are ?1 and ?2 respectively. Since the angle ? is very small we may write

?  ? ??

and  ?  ?  2? .

     Let the distance between the slit and the screen be f which is also equal to the focal length of the lens if the lens is placed close to the slit. Let the linear distance on the screen between successive minima corresponding to the angular separation ?2 - ?1 (= ?/a) be d (Fig. 13.3)


Thus, we have	d

     3. Find the half angular width of the central bright maximum in the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of a slit of width 0.5 mm when the slit is illuminated by monochromatic light of wavelength 589.3 nm.
Solution
We have sin ? = ?/a where ? is the half angular width of the central maximum.

sin ? =  589.3 ? 10?9
0.5 ? 10?3


= 1.1786 × 10-3

or	? = 1.18 × 10-3 rad.
     4. When monochromatic light is incident on a slit 0.02 mm wide, the first diffraction minimum is observed at an angle of 1.5° from the direction of the direct beam. What is the wavelength of the incident light?

     5. Light of wavelength 630 nm is incident on a narrow slit. The angle between the first minimum on one side of the central maximum and the first minimum on the other side is 1°. What is the width of the slit?

     6. The distance between the first and fifth minima of a single-slit pattern is 0.35 mm with the screen 40 cm away from the slit, using light having a wavelength of 560 nm.
(a) Calculate the diffraction angle ? of the first minimum. (b) Find the width of the slit.
Solution
     (a) Let the angle of diffraction be ?5 for the fifth minimum, and the corresponding distance on the screen from the central maximum be d5. Thus,
?  = 5? =  d5  and ? =  d
5	D	D
where ? = diffraction angle of the first minimum
d = distance of the first minimum on the screen from the central maximum
D = distance of the screen from the slit.




So, we have



4? =  ds ? d ? 0.35 mm
	

D	400 mm
or	? = 2.19 × 10-4 rad.

     7. A parallel beam of light is incident normally on a narrow slit of width 0.22 mm. The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern is observed on a screen which is placed at the focal plane of a convex lens whose focal length is 70 cm. Calculate the distance between the first two secondary maxima on the screen. The wavelength of light = 600 nm and the lens is placed very close to the slit.
Solution
The first and second maxima occur at ? = 1.43? and 2.46?. Thus,
a sin ? = 1.43? and 2.46?

or	sin? = 1.43?
a
and	sin? =  2.46?
a


= 3.9 × 10-3 for 1st maximum

= 6.71 × 10-3 for 2nd maximum.

Consequently the maxima will be separated on the screen by the distance given by (6.71 - 3.9) × 10-3 × 70 = 0.2 cm.
     8. Sound waves with frequency 3000 H/ diffract out of a speaker cabinet with a 0.3 m diameter opening into a large auditorium. Velocity of sound in air is 343 m/s. Where does a listener standing against a wall 100 m from the speaker have the most difficulty in hearing? Assume single slit diffraction from a slit of width 0.3 m.
Solution
The first minima occur at B and B? on two sides of the central maximum A (Fig. 13.4).
Now,	? =	343 m

and	sin ? = ?? ?

or	? = 22.4°
tan ? =	AB

or	AB = 41.2 m and AB? = 41.2 m.
     9. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the central diffraction maximum is defined as the angle between the two points in the pattern where the intensity is one-half of that at the centre of the pattern. (a) Show that FWHM is
?? = 2 sin-1 (0.442?/a)
where a is the width of the single slit. (b) Calculate the FWHM of the central maximum for slits whose widths are 1.5? and 10?.
Solution

(a) From Eqn. (13.3), we find that I = 1
2

I	when sin2 ? = 1 ?2. This transcendental

equation has a solution ? = 1.39 radians.
Thus, we have ??a sin ? = 1.39
?
or	sin ? =
and FWHM is ?? = 2 sin-1 (0.442 ?/a).
(b) When a = 1.5?, ?? = 34.28° When a = 10?, ?? = 5.07°.




1.39? = 0.442?/a,

     10. Find the smallest angular separation of two narrow slit sources which could be resolved theoretically (according to Rayleigh's criterion of just resolution) by a rectangular slit of width a.
Solution
     Two narrow sources form real images on the screen after passing through the rectangular aperture. Each image consists of a single-slit diffraction pattern. The angular separation of the sources ? is equal to the angular separation of the central maxima. According to Rayleigh's criterion for just resolution two images appear to be just resolved when the principal maximum of one falls on the 1st minimum of the other i.e.,
? = ?1
where ?1 is the diffraction angle of the 1st minimum
sin ?1 ? ?1 = ?/a.
Thus at just resolution of two images the angular separation of two narrow slits is
? = ?/a.
     11. Find the smallest angular separation of two narrow slit sources which could be resolved by a rectangular slit of width 1?. [Take the mean value of ? = 6000 Å]

     12. Circular aperture: When a monochromatic beam of parallel rays of wavelength ? falls normally on a circular aperture of diameter a, the emergent rays produce circular diffraction pattern.

by
I = Im J 2 (2?) / ? 2
where	? = ?? a sin ? ,
2?
     J1 (2?) is the Bessel function of order 1, and Im is the intensity of the central maximum (? = 0).
(b) Find the positions of the maxima and the minima of the circular diffraction pattern.
Solution
     OAB is one quadrant of a circular aperture of diameter a, with its plane in y/-plane (Fig. 13.5). The plane waves are incident on the aperture in the x-direction. The circular aperture is divided into elementary diffracting areas s ds d?, each acting as a secondary
source of disturbance. On account of the presence of circular symmetry we choose a point P? having coordinates (x0, y0, 0) in the xy-plane. The distance of P? from the centre of the aperture is r and ? is the angle of diffraction. We wish to find the resultant disturbance at
P?. We have

     Let the distance of P? from the elementary area s ds d? be ?. A disturbance originating at the elementary area produces a displacement du at P? proportional to the area and is


given by
du = B (s ds d?) sin(?t - k?),	...(13.5)

where B is the proportionality constant,	=  2?

since ?1 is a very small angle.
     We get a circular diffraction pattern with a very bright central disc which is called Airy's disc, followed by a series of alternate dark and bright rings of decreasing intensity. The ratio
I	=  Intensity at the secondary maximum

for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd secondary bright rings are 0.0175, 0.00416, 0.00160 respectively. The intensity of the rings fades away rapidly as the rings recede from the centre. So, the pattern will be limited only to a small region near the centre.


     If a convex lens of focal length f is placed very close to the aperture and the pattern is seen on a screen, the linear radius d of the first dark ring is given by

     [Note: Actually an average person cannot resolve objects less than about 1 minute apart. This is because the separation of two images is decreased by refraction of the rays as they enter the eye (n = 1.33 and ?1 = 50 × 1.33 seconds)]

The diameter of the central maximum of the beam at the shuttle position was said to be 28 ft and the beam wavelength was 540 nm. What is the effective diameter of the laser aperture at the Maui ground station? Assume circular exit aperture of the laser beam.

At the point P0, ? = 0, ? = ? = 0 and we get the position of the central maximum. If Im
is the intensity at the central maximum then we have
                                   I = Im cos2 ? sin2 ?/?2	...(13.15) The factor sin2 ?/?2 is the factor for diffraction due to the single slit of width a. The factor cos2 ? is the characteristic of the interference pattern produced by the two beams of equal intensity and a phase difference. In Young's experiment of double slits [see problem 1

of chapter 12] the resultant intensity is proportional to cos2 ??

     18. Find the positions of the maxima and the minima of the double-slit diffraction pattern of problem 17.
Solution
     Positions of minima: The resultant intensity I [Eqn. (13.15)] is zero when either of the factors cos2 ? or sin2 ?/?2 is zero.
(i) Minima of the interference pattern: cos2 ? = 0
or	? = + Jjm ? 17j?, , m = 0, 1, 2,...
H	2J
or	d sin ? = + Jjm ? 17j?,	m = 0, 1, 2,.	(13.16)
H	2J
(ii) Minima of the diffraction pattern: sin2 ?/?2 = 0,
or	? = + p?, p = 1, 2, 3,...
or	a sin? = + p?, p = 1, 2, 3,.	(13.17)
     Positions of maxima: The exact positions of the maxima are not given by any simple relation, but their approximate positions may be found by neglecting the variation of the factor sin2?/?2, a justifiable assumption only when d is large compared to a and the maxima only near the centre of the pattern are considered. For the same small value of ? near the centre of the pattern, ? is small compared to ?. In that case, sin2?/?2 ? 1 and the positions of the maxima will be determined solely by the cos2? factor, which has maxima for ? = + m?, m = 0, 1, 2,...
or	d sin ? = +m?, m = 0, 1, 2,.	(13.18)
Since ? is small we may write
? = + m?/d, m = 0, 1, 2,.	(13.19)
Thus, the maxima near the centre are equispaced.
     When the slit width a is not very small, the variation of the factor sin2 ?/?2 with ? must be taken into account. The complete double slit pattern is the product of two factors cos2? and sin2 ?/?2. In this case the positions of the maxima are slightly different from those given by Eqn. (13.18) except for the central maximum (m = 0).
     If the slit width a is much small compared to d, we get many interference maxima within the central maximum of the diffraction pattern. In the central diffraction maximum, sin? varies from ??/a to ?/a or ?? ? 2 ?/a. The width of a bright interference fringe = ?/d. In general, the number of interference maxima within the central diffraction maximum =
= 2d . But sometimes the interference maximum falls on the diffraction minimum
a
and it cannot be seen. In that case the number of interference maxima occurring under the


central diffraction maximum is

Jj 2d ? 17j .

H a	J
     Missing orders: It is sometimes seen that certain interference maxima are missing. These so-called missing orders occur when the condition for a maximum of the interference and the condition for a minimum of the diffraction are satisfied for the same value of ?, i.e.,
d sin ? = m?
and	a sin ? = p?




or	d

i.e., d a

a


= 2, orders m = 2, 4, 6,... are missing and

the number of interference maxima under the central diffraction maximum = 1 + 2 × 1 = 3.

When d
a

= 3, order m = 3, 6, 9,... are missing and the number of interference maxima under

the central diffraction maximum = 1 + 2 × 2 = 5.
     19. In a double-slit experiment the distance D of the screen from the slits is 60 cm, the wavelength ? is 500 nm, the slit separation d is 0.12 mm, and the slit width a is 0.025 mm.
(a) What is the spacing between adjacent fringes? (b) What is the distance from the central maximum to the first minimum of the fringe envelope (diffraction factor)? (c) How many fringes are there in the central peak of the diffraction envelope?
Solution
(a) The spacing between the adjacent fringes

= ?y = ??
d

D =  (500 ? 10?9) (60 ? 10?2) m
0.12 ? 10?3

(b) The minimum of the diffraction factor is given by

sin ? = ??
a

=	500 ? 10?9
0.025 ? 10?3


= 0.02

Since sin? is very small we can put
sin ? ? tan ? ? ? = 0.02.
Thus the distance of the first minimum of the diffraction factor from the central maximum
is
y = D tan ? = 60 × 0.02 cm = 1.2 cm.

L	a	Q
     20. What requirements must be met for the central maximum of the envelope of the double-slit interference pattern to contain exactly 9 fringes?
Solution
     The required condition will be met if the fifth minimum of the interference factor coincides with the first minimum of the diffraction factor. The fifth minimum of the interference
factor occurs when ? = 9 ?. The first minimum in the diffraction term occurs for ? = ?. Thus,
2

we get


?? = d
?	a

     21. In problem 20 the envelope of the central peak contains 9 fringes. How many fringes lie between the first and the second minima of the envelop?
Solution

We have	?? = d
?	a

=  9 .
2

     The first minimum in the diffraction term occurs at ? = ? or, sin? = ?/a. The second minimum occurs at ? = 2? or, sin? = 2?/a.
The interference maxima occur at sin? =  m? =  2m? ,  m = 0, 1, 2,...
d	9a
The  interference  maxima  lying  between  the  sin?  =  ?/a  and  sin?  =  2?/a  are
10? , 12? , 14? , 16? . So, four fringes lie between the first and the second minima of the
9a	9a	9a	9a
envelope.
    22. A parallel beam of monochromatic light is incident normally on N number of parallel and equidistant slits (diffraction grating). Show that the intensity of the rays diffracted at an angle ? in the Fraunhofer pattern is given by

where  ? = ??a sin ?, ? = ??d sin ?,
?	?

a = width of each slit, d = distance between the centres
of two consecutive slits, and A2 sin2 ?/?2 represents the intensity due to diffraction by a single slit.
Solution
     A parallel beam of light rays is allowed to be incident normally on N number of parallel and equidistant slits (Fig. 13.7). When the diffracted beams are collected by the






Fig. 13.7

telescope we find a number of intensely bright lines in the field of view. Let the width of each opaque space be b, then d = a + b. The path difference between the beams coming from any two consecutive corresponding points in the N-slits and diffracted at an angle ? is given by
                                    ? = d sin ?, and the corresponding phase difference ? is

? =  2?
?

? =  2? d sin ?.
?

Let ? = ??  = ??d sin ? = 1 kd sin ?.

2	?	2
     The amplitudes contributed by the individual slits are all of equal magnitude. The phase will change by equal amounts ? from one slit to the next. Suppose that the magnitude of the amplitude of the contribution of each slit is B. Then, the resultant complex amplitude is the sum of the series


B[1 + ei? + e2i? + .... + ei(N - 1)?] 1 ? eiN?
= B 1 ? ei?
= A ei?, say.
The intensity is found by multiplying this expression by its complex conjugate:
(1 ? eiN? ) (1 ? e?iN? )

A2 = B2



(1 ? ei? ) (1 ? e?i? )

= B2 1 ? cos N?
1 ? cos ?

= B2 sin2 N? .
sin2 ?

The factor B2 represents the intensity due to diffraction by a single slit [see Eqn. 13.2].
B2 =  A2 sin2 ? ?2 ;

? =  1

ka sin ? = ?a sin ?.

Thus, the intensity on the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of an array of N slits is given

     23. (a) Show that the mth principal maximum of the N-slit diffraction pattern of problem 22 occurs when
d sin ?m = +m?, m = 0, 1, 2,...
     (b) Show that there will be (N - 1) points of /ero intensity between two adjacent principal maxima. (c) When do we get absent spectra? (d) What is the effect of the diffraction envelope sin2 ?/?2 on the intensity of the principal maxima?
Solution

(a) The factor sin2 N?
sin2 ?

in Eqn. (13.20) may be said to represent the interference term

for N slits. It possesses maximum value N2 for ? = + m?, m = 0, 1, 2,..., because

lim sin N?


=	lim

 N cos N?


= +N.

???m?  sin?

???m?

Thus, for the mth principal maximum we have
? = ??d sin ?



= +m?

?	m
or	d sin ?m = +m?, m = 0, 1, 2,...

(b) The function sin2 N?
sin2 ?

vanishes when ? =  p? excluding p = mN, m = 0, 1, 2,... and
N

p = 1, 2, 3,....


when p = mN, ? = m? and we have principal maxima. Hence, the conditions for interference minima are
d sin ? =  ??  ,  2? ,...,  (N ? 1)? ,  (N ? 1)? ,...
N	N	N	N
and the conditions for principal maxima are
d sin ? = 0, ?, 2?,...
     Thus between two adjacent principal maxima there will be (N - 1) points of zero intensity.
     (c) It is sometimes seen that certain orders of N-slit diffraction spectra are absent even if they satisfy the condition of interference maxima. We know that the intensity of the diffraction pattern is governed by two factors, one due to diffraction by a single slit (sin2 ?/?2), and the other due to interference (sin2 N?/sin2 ?). It may happen that for a particular N-slit spectra, the direction in which the interference factor gives maximum, the diffraction factor vanishes:
d sin ? = m?, m = 1, 2, 3,...interference maxima
a sin ? = p?, p = 1, 2, 3,...diffraction minima.
If these two conditions are simultaneously satisfied, mth order maxima will be missing.
Thus, the condition for absent spectra is

d = m
a	p

or	a ? b a

= m .
p

If d a
If d a

= 2, m = 2p and m = 2, 4, 6,...order spectra are missing.

= 3, m = 3p and m = 3, 6, 9,...order spectra are missing.

     (d) The relative intensities of the different orders m are governed by the single-slit diffraction envelope sin2?/?2. Due to this term the central maximum has the maximum intensity and the intensity decreases with the increase in the order m. For large m, the intensity will be very low.

d sin ?m = m?.
Let ?m + ??m and ?m - ??m be the directions of the first minima on the two sides of the

Thus, we have

??m is the half angular width of the mth principal maximum. It is inversely proportional to N and cos ?m. With increase in ?m, cos ?m decreases and ??m increases. Thus ??m is more for higher orders. The value of ??m is also higher for longer wavelengths.
     25. A parallel beam of monochromatic light is incident normally on a plane transmission grating having 2990 lines per cm and a third order spectral line is observed to be deviated through 30°. Calculate the wavelength of the spectral line.

We have	d sin ?1 = 2?1
and	d sin ?2 = 2?2

with	d =	1

Thus,	sin ?1  =  2 × 5.890 × 10-5 × 5000 = 0.5890
sin ?2  =  2 × 5.896 × 10-5 × 5000 = 0.5896
?1  =  36.086° and ?2 = 36.129°.
Angular separation = ?2 - ?1 = 0.043° = 2.58 minutes of an arc.

We have	d sin ? = 5?.

Thus,	? =	10?3
5 ? 315

     Maximum value of ? is 90°. Thus the required wavelengths in the visible spectrum are all wavelength between 400 nm and 634.92 nm.

When	? = 5890 Å, sin ? = 3 × 5.890 × 10-5 × 5000 = 0.8835
and	? = 62.0675°
When	? = 5896 Å, sin ?? = 3 × 5.896 × 10-5 × 5000 = 0.8844
and	?? = 62.1778°
Therefore the linear distance on the screen is
?y = 100 × (tan ?? - tan ?) = 0.88 cm.
     31. What is the maximum width, a, of any clear space in a grating having 104 lines per inch, if complete second order visible spectrum is to be formed?
Solution

d = 2.54
104

= 2.54 × 10-4 cm.

The maximum angle ? in the second order visible spectrum (? = 700 nm) is given by

sin ? =  2 ? 7.0 ? 10?5
2.54 ? 10?4


= 0.5512.

     The half angular breadth of the central diffraction band must accommodate the complete second order spectrum, i.e.,

sin ? = ??
a

= 7.0 ? 10?5
a


= 0.5512

or	a = 7 ? 10?5
0.5512


cm = 1.27 × 10-4 cm.

Note that this is just half the grating element d.
     32. Show that the dispersion D and the resolving power R of a grating are given respectively

D =  d?
d?

d cos?




and	R = ? ? 
??


= Nm,

where d is grating element, m is the order number and N is the total number of rulings on the grating.
Solution
If the incident rays of wavelengths ? and ? + d? are diffracted in the direction ? and
? + d? respectively for the mth order of the bright fringe, the dispersive power of the grating

is given by  d?
d?

i.e., by the rate of variation of the angle of diffraction with the wavelength.

Differentiating the grating equation
d sin ? = m?

with respect to ?, we get


d cos ?  d?
d?



= m.

Thus, the dispersive power D of the grating is

D =  d?
d?

=	m	.
d cos ?

...(13.22)

A spectrum for which  d?
d?

is constant is known as the rational or normal spectrum.

     Let us consider two spectral lines of wavelengths ? and ? + ??. Owing to dispersion, the angular separation between the lines in the mth order is given by

?? =	m
d cos ?

??.

Again, half angular width of the mth principal maximum is (see problem 24)

??m

=  ?	?	 .
Nd cos ?

     According to Rayleigh's criterion, two lines are just resolved when the principal maximum of one falls on the first minimum of the other i.e., when the angle between the centres of two images is half the angular width of the principal maximum, i.e., ?? = ??m.

Thus, we have	m
d cos ?

?? =	?
Nd cos ?

or	Rm

=  ? ? 
??

= mN.	(13.23)

The quantity Rm is called the resolving power in the mth order, ?? is the smallest

difference of wavelength for which the spectral lines ? - 1
2

?? and ? + 1 ?? are resolveable.

Note that the resolving power is the same for all wavelengths.

Solution
(a)	d =	1

sin ? =  2?
d

Dispersive power, D =	m
d cos ?

= 1.238 × 106 rad m-1.

(b)	?? = ??D = 6 × 10 -10 × 1.238 × 106 = 7.428 × 10-4 rad
= 0.043°.
     34. What should be the minimum number of lines in a grating that will just resolve in the second order the D1 and D2 lines of sodium?
Solution

Resolving power,	R = ? ? 
??

= mN.

Thus,	N = 5893 × 1
6	2

= 491.08.

The grating must have at least 492 lines.
     35. A section through the NaCl cell lattice is shown in Fig. 13.9. The unit cells, each of dimension a0, in this section are represented by small dots. The dashed sloping lines represent an arbitrary family of planes with characteristic interplanar spacing d. (a) Show

that d = a0 /
Solution
(b) 
Derive Bragg's law: 2d sin? = m?, m = 1, 2, 3,...

(a) From Fig. 13.9, we have

sin ? = e f

Thus	d =	a0

...(13.24)

     (b) To have a constructive interference in the beam diffracted in the direction ? (Fig. 13.9) from the entire family of planes, the rays from the separate planes must reinforce each other. Thus the path difference for rays from adjacent planes (abc in Fig. 13.9) must be an integral number of wavelengths,
or	2d sin ? = m?, m = 1, 2, 3,.	(13.25)
     This is known as Bragg's law. It should be noted that the angle ? is measured from the surface of the crystal, not from the normal to that surface.
     36. At what angles must an x-ray beam with ? = 1 Å fall on the family of planes represented in Fig. 13.9 if a diffracted beam is to exist? Assume the material to be sodium chloride (a0 = 5.63 Å).
Solution
The interplanar spacing d is given by




Bragg's law gives

d =  a0

=  5.63 Å = 2.5178 Å.

sin ? =  m?
2d

=  m ? 1	 2 ? 2.5178

= 0.1986 × m.

When m = 1, ? = 11.46°; m = 2, ? = 23.40°; m = 3, ? = 36.57°; m = 4, ? = 52.60°;
m = 5, ? = 83.22°. Higher order beams cannot exist because they require that sin? > 1. Actually the unit cell in cubic crystals such as NaCl has diffraction properties such that the intensity of diffracted x-ray beams corresponding to odd values of m is zero. Thus the angles are ? = 23.40° (m = 2) and ? = 52.60° (m = 4).
     37. Monochromatic x-rays are incident on a set of crystal planes whose interplanar spacing is 40 pm. When the beam is rotated 60° from the normal, first-order Bragg reflection is observed. What is the wavelength of the x-rays?
Solution
Here ? = 30°, hence
? = 2d sin 30° = d = 40 pm.
     38. In comparing the wavelengths of two monochromatic x-ray lines, it is noted that line A gives a first-order reflection maximum at a glancing angle of 24° to the smooth face of a crystal. Line B, known to have a wavelength of 96 pm, gives a third-order reflection maximum at an angle of 60° from the same face of the same crystal. (a) Calculate the interplanar spacing. (b) Find the wavelength of line A.
Solution
We have	2d sin 24° = ?A
and	2d sin 60° = 3 × 96 pm, which give (a) d = 166.28 pm (b) ?A = 135.26 pm.


39. Yellow light is used in a single slit diffraction experiment with slit width of 0.6 mm.
If  yellow light is replaced by x-rays, the observed pattern will reveal
(a) that the central maximum is narrower
(b) more number of fringes
(c) less number of fringes
(d) no diffraction pattern.	(I.I.T. 1999)
Solution
Slit width = a = 0.6 mm = 0.6 × 10-3 m Wavelength of x-rays = ? ? 1 Å = 10-10 m
a  = 0.6 × 107 >> 1
?
a is very large compared to the wavelength ?.
In this case, the diffraction pattern disappears.
Correct Choice: d.
     40. A parallel monochromatic beam of light is incident normally on a narrow slit. A diffraction pattern is formed on a screen placed perpendicular to the direction of the incident beam. At the first minimum of the diffraction pattern the phase difference between the rays coming from the two edges of the slit is
(a) 0 (b) ?/2 (c) ? (d) 2??	(I.I.T. 1998)
Solution
Path difference for the rays coming from the two edges of the slit is
? = a sin ?, a = slit width.
For the first minimum, ? = ?
where	? =  ??a sin ? = ?

x1 = A cos ?1t + A? sin ?1t + B cos ?2t + B? sin ?2t x2  = A cos ?1t + A? sin ?1t - B cos ?2t - B? sin ?2t

(iii) ? = 0 corresponds to pure translation of the system:
x = x2 = x3.
? = ?2 gives x2 = 0 and x1 = -x3.

? = ?

gives x = x  and x = - 2x1 m ? ?2x3 m .
